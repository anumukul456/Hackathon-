Build Swap Applications on EVM#
There are two approaches to building swap applications with OKX DEX on EVM networks:

The API-first approach - directly interacting with OKX DEX API endpoints
The SDK approach - using the @okx-dex/okx-dex-sdk package for a simplified developer experience
This guide covers both methods to help you choose the approach that best fits your needs.

Method 1: API-First Approach#
This approach demonstrates a token swap using the OKX DEX API endpoints directly. You will swap USDC to ETH on the Ethereum network.

1. Set Up Your Environment#
// --------------------- npm package ---------------------
import { Web3 } from 'web3';
import axios from 'axios';
import * as dotenv from 'dotenv';
import CryptoJS from 'crypto-js';
// The URL for the Ethereum node you want to connect to
const web3 = new Web3('https://......com');
// --------------------- environment variable ---------------------

// Load hidden environment variables
dotenv.config();

// Your wallet information - REPLACE WITH YOUR OWN VALUES
const WALLET_ADDRESS: string = process.env.EVM_WALLET_ADDRESS || '0xYourWalletAddress';
const PRIVATE_KEY: string = process.env.EVM_PRIVATE_KEY || 'YourPrivateKey'; 

// Token addresses for swap on Base Chain
const ETH_ADDRESS: string = '0xEeeeeEeeeEeEeeEeEeEeeEEEeeeeEeeeeeeeEEeE'; // Native ETH
const USDC_ADDRESS: string = '0x833589fCD6eDb6E08f4c7C32D4f71b54bdA02913'; // USDC on Base

// Chain ID for Base Chain
const chainId: string = '8453';

// API URL
const baseUrl: string = 'https://web3.okx.com/api/v5/';

// Amount to swap in smallest unit (0.0005 ETH)
const SWAP_AMOUNT: string = '500000000000000'; // 0.0005 ETH
const SLIPPAGE: string = '0.005'; // 0.5% slippage tolerance

// --------------------- util function ---------------------
export function getHeaders(timestamp: string, method: string, requestPath: string, queryString = "") {
// Check https://web3.okx.com/zh-hans/web3/build/docs/waas/rest-authentication for api-key
    const apiKey = process.env.OKX_API_KEY;
    const secretKey = process.env.OKX_SECRET_KEY;
    const apiPassphrase = process.env.OKX_API_PASSPHRASE;
    const projectId = process.env.OKX_PROJECT_ID;

    if (!apiKey || !secretKey || !apiPassphrase || !projectId) {
        throw new Error("Missing required environment variables");
    }

    const stringToSign = timestamp + method + requestPath + queryString;
    return {
        "Content-Type": "application/json",
        "OK-ACCESS-KEY": apiKey,
        "OK-ACCESS-SIGN": CryptoJS.enc.Base64.stringify(
            CryptoJS.HmacSHA256(stringToSign, secretKey)
        ),
        "OK-ACCESS-TIMESTAMP": timestamp,
        "OK-ACCESS-PASSPHRASE": apiPassphrase,
        "OK-ACCESS-PROJECT": projectId,
    };
};
2. Check Allowance#
You need to check if the token has been approved for the DEX to spend. This step is only needed for ERC20 tokens, not for native tokens like ETH.

/**
 * Check token allowance for DEX
 * @param tokenAddress - Token contract address
 * @param ownerAddress - Your wallet address
 * @param spenderAddress - DEX spender address
 * @returns Allowance amount
 */
async function checkAllowance(
  tokenAddress: string,
  ownerAddress: string,
  spenderAddress: string
): Promise<bigint> {
  const tokenABI = [
    {
      "constant": true,
      "inputs": [
        { "name": "_owner", "type": "address" },
        { "name": "_spender", "type": "address" }
      ],
      "name": "allowance",
      "outputs": [{ "name": "", "type": "uint256" }],
      "payable": false,
      "stateMutability": "view",
      "type": "function"
    }
  ];

  const tokenContract = new web3.eth.Contract(tokenABI, tokenAddress);
  try {
    const allowance = await tokenContract.methods.allowance(ownerAddress, spenderAddress).call();
    return BigInt(String(allowance));
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Failed to query allowance:', error);
    throw error;
  }
}
3. Check the Approval Parameters and Initiate the Approval#
If the allowance is lower than the amount you want to swap, you need to approve the token.

3.1 Define your transaction approval parameters

const getApproveTransactionParams = {
  chainId: chainId,
  tokenContractAddress: tokenAddress,
  approveAmount: amount
};
3.2 Define helper functions

async function getApproveTransaction(
  tokenAddress: string,
  amount: string
): Promise<any> {
  try {
    const path = 'dex/aggregator/approve-transaction';
    const url = `${baseUrl}${path}`;
    const params = {
      chainId: chainId,
      tokenContractAddress: tokenAddress,
      approveAmount: amount
    };

    // Prepare authentication
    const timestamp = new Date().toISOString();
    const requestPath = `/api/v5/${path}`;
    const queryString = "?" + new URLSearchParams(params).toString();
    const headers = getHeaders(timestamp, 'GET', requestPath, queryString);

    const response = await axios.get(url, { params, headers });

    if (response.data.code === '0') {
      return response.data.data[0];
    } else {
      throw new Error(`API Error: ${response.data.msg || 'Unknown error'}`);
    }
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Failed to get approval transaction data:', (error as Error).message);
    throw error;
  }
}
3.3 Create Compute gasLimit utility function

Using the Onchain gateway API to get the gas limit.

/**
 * Get transaction gas limit from Onchain gateway API
 * @param fromAddress - Sender address
 * @param toAddress - Target contract address
 * @param txAmount - Transaction amount (0 for approvals)
 * @param inputData - Transaction calldata
 * @returns Estimated gas limit
 */
async function getGasLimit(
  fromAddress: string,
  toAddress: string,
  txAmount: string = '0',
  inputData: string = ''
): Promise<string> {
  try {
    const path = 'dex/pre-transaction/gas-limit';
    const url = `https://web3.okx.com/api/v5/${path}`;

    const body = {
      chainIndex: chainId,
      fromAddress: fromAddress,
      toAddress: toAddress,
      txAmount: txAmount,
      extJson: {
        inputData: inputData
      }
    };

    // Prepare authentication with body included in signature
    const bodyString = JSON.stringify(body);
    const timestamp = new Date().toISOString();
    const requestPath = `/api/v5/${path}`;
    const headers = getHeaders(timestamp, 'POST', requestPath, "", bodyString);

    const response = await axios.post(url, body, { headers });

    if (response.data.code === '0') {
      return response.data.data[0].gasLimit;
    } else {
      throw new Error(`API Error: ${response.data.msg || 'Unknown error'}`);
    }
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Failed to get gas limit:', (error as Error).message);
    throw error;
  }
}
Using RPC to get the gas limit.

const gasLimit = await web3.eth.estimateGas({
  from: WALLET_ADDRESS,
  to: tokenAddress,
  value: '0',
  data: approveData.data
});

// Add 20% buffer
const gasLimit = (BigInt(gasLimit) * BigInt(12) / BigInt(10)).toString();
3.4 Get transaction information and send approveTransaction

/**
 * Sign and send approve transaction
 * @param tokenAddress - Token to approve
 * @param amount - Amount to approve
 * @returns Transaction hash of the approval transaction
 */
async function approveToken(tokenAddress: string, amount: string): Promise<string | null> {
  const spenderAddress = '0x3b3ae790Df4F312e745D270119c6052904FB6790'; // Ethereum Mainnet DEX spender
  // See Router addresses at:  https://web3.okx.com/build/docs/waas/dex-smart-contract
  const currentAllowance = await checkAllowance(tokenAddress, WALLET_ADDRESS, spenderAddress);

  if (currentAllowance >= BigInt(amount)) {
    console.log('Sufficient allowance already exists');
    return null;
  }

  console.log('Insufficient allowance, approving tokens...');

  // Get approve transaction data from OKX DEX API
  const approveData = await getApproveTransaction(tokenAddress, amount);

  // Get accurate gas limit using RPC
  const gasLimit = await web3.eth.estimateGas({
    from: WALLET_ADDRESS,
    to: tokenAddress,
    value: '0',
    data: approveData.data
  });

  // Get accurate gas limit using Onchain gateway API
//   const gasLimit = await getGasLimit(WALLET_ADDRESS, tokenAddress, '0', approveData.data);

  // Get current gas price
  const gasPrice = await web3.eth.getGasPrice();
  const adjustedGasPrice = BigInt(gasPrice) * BigInt(15) / BigInt(10); // 1.5x for faster confirmation

  // Get current nonce
  const nonce = await web3.eth.getTransactionCount(WALLET_ADDRESS, 'latest');

  // Create transaction object
  const txObject = {
    from: WALLET_ADDRESS,
    to: tokenAddress,
    data: approveData.data,
    value: '0',
    gas: gasLimit,
    gasPrice: adjustedGasPrice.toString(),
    nonce: nonce
  };

  // Sign and broadcast transaction
  const signedTx = await web3.eth.accounts.signTransaction(txObject, PRIVATE_KEY);
  const receipt = await web3.eth.sendSignedTransaction(signedTx.rawTransaction);
  
  console.log(`Approval transaction successful: ${receipt.transactionHash}`);
  return receipt.transactionHash;
}
4. Get Quote Data#
4.1 Define quote parameters

const quoteParams = {
  amount: fromAmount,
  chainId: chainId,
  toTokenAddress: toTokenAddress,
  fromTokenAddress: fromTokenAddress,
};
4.2 Define helper functions

/**
 * Get swap quote from DEX API
 * @param fromTokenAddress - Source token address
 * @param toTokenAddress - Destination token address
 * @param amount - Amount to swap
 * @param slippage - Maximum slippage (e.g., "0.005" for 0.5%)
 * @returns Swap quote
 */
async function getSwapQuote(
  fromTokenAddress: string,
  toTokenAddress: string,
  amount: string,
  slippage: string = '0.005'
): Promise<any> {
  try {
    const path = 'dex/aggregator/quote';
    const url = `${baseUrl}${path}`;

    const params = {
      chainId: chainId,
      fromTokenAddress,
      toTokenAddress,
      amount,
      slippage
    };

    // Prepare authentication
    const timestamp = new Date().toISOString();
    const requestPath = `/api/v5/${path}`;
    const queryString = "?" + new URLSearchParams(params).toString();
    const headers = getHeaders(timestamp, 'GET', requestPath, queryString);

    const response = await axios.get(url, { params, headers });

    if (response.data.code === '0') {
      return response.data.data[0];
    } else {
      throw new Error(`API Error: ${response.data.msg || 'Unknown error'}`);
    }
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Failed to get swap quote:', (error as Error).message);
    throw error;
  }
}
5. Prepare Transaction#
5.1 Define swap parameters

const swapParams = {
      chainId: chainId,
      fromTokenAddress,
      toTokenAddress,
      amount,
      userWalletAddress: userAddress,
      slippage
};
5.2 Request swap transaction data

/**
 * Get swap transaction data from DEX API
 * @param fromTokenAddress - Source token address
 * @param toTokenAddress - Destination token address
 * @param amount - Amount to swap
 * @param userAddress - User wallet address
 * @param slippage - Maximum slippage (e.g., "0.005" for 0.5%)
 * @returns Swap transaction data
 */
async function getSwapTransaction(
  fromTokenAddress: string,
  toTokenAddress: string,
  amount: string,
  userAddress: string,
  slippage: string = '0.005'
): Promise<any> {
  try {
    const path = 'dex/aggregator/swap';
    const url = `${baseUrl}${path}`;

    const params = {
      chainId: chainId,
      fromTokenAddress,
      toTokenAddress,
      amount,
      userWalletAddress: userAddress,
      slippage
    };

    // Prepare authentication
    const timestamp = new Date().toISOString();
    const requestPath = `/api/v5/${path}`;
    const queryString = "?" + new URLSearchParams(params).toString();
    const headers = getHeaders(timestamp, 'GET', requestPath, queryString);

    const response = await axios.get(url, { params, headers });

    if (response.data.code === '0') {
      return response.data.data[0];
    } else {
      throw new Error(`API Error: ${response.data.msg || 'Unknown error'}`);
    }
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Failed to get swap transaction data:', (error as Error).message);
    throw error;
  }
}
6. Simulate Transaction#
Before executing the actual swap, it's crucial to simulate the transaction to ensure it will succeed and to identify any potential issues:

The Simulate API is available to our whitelisted customers only. Please reach out to dexapi@okx.com to request access.

async function simulateTransaction(swapData: any) {
    try {
        if (!swapData.tx) {
            throw new Error('Invalid swap data format - missing transaction data');
        }

        const tx = swapData.tx;
        const params: any = {
            fromAddress: tx.from,
            toAddress: tx.to,
            txAmount: tx.value || '0',
            chainIndex: chainId,
            extJson: {
                inputData: tx.data
            },
            includeDebug: true
        };

        const timestamp = new Date().toISOString();
        const requestPath = "/api/v5/dex/pre-transaction/simulate";
        const requestBody = JSON.stringify(params);
        const headers = getHeaders(timestamp, "POST", requestPath, "", requestBody);

        console.log('Simulating transaction...');
        const response = await axios.post(
            `https://web3.okx.com${requestPath}`, 
            params, 
            { headers }
        );

        if (response.data.code !== "0") {
            throw new Error(`Simulation failed: ${response.data.msg || "Unknown simulation error"}`);
        }

        const simulationResult = response.data.data[0];
        
        // Check simulation success
        if (simulationResult.success === false) {
            console.error('Transaction simulation failed:', simulationResult.error);
            throw new Error(`Transaction would fail: ${simulationResult.error}`);
        }

        console.log('Transaction simulation successful');
        console.log(`Estimated gas used: ${simulationResult.gasUsed || 'N/A'}`);
        
        if (simulationResult.logs) {
            console.log('Simulation logs:', simulationResult.logs);
        }

        return simulationResult;
    } catch (error) {
        console.error("Error simulating transaction:", error);
        throw error;
    }
}
7. Broadcast Transaction#
Creating a Compute Gas Limit Utility Function There are two approaches to obtain the gas limit for your transactions: using standard RPC calls or leveraging the Onchain Gateway API.

Method 1: Using the Onchain Gateway API for Gas Estimation

The first approach leverages OKX's Onchain Gateway API, which provides more accurate gas estimations than standard methods.

/**
 * Get transaction gas limit from Onchain gateway API
 * @param fromAddress - Sender address
 * @param toAddress - Target contract address
 * @param txAmount - Transaction amount (0 for approvals)
 * @param inputData - Transaction calldata
 * @returns Estimated gas limit
 */
async function getGasLimit(
  fromAddress: string,
  toAddress: string,
  txAmount: string = '0',
  inputData: string = ''
): Promise<string> {
  try {
    const path = 'dex/pre-transaction/gas-limit';
    const url = `https://web3.okx.com/api/v5/${path}`;

    const body = {
      chainIndex: chainId,
      fromAddress: fromAddress,
      toAddress: toAddress,
      txAmount: txAmount,
      extJson: {
        inputData: inputData
      }
    };

    // Prepare authentication with body included in signature
    const bodyString = JSON.stringify(body);
    const timestamp = new Date().toISOString();
    const requestPath = `/api/v5/${path}`;
    const headers = getHeaders(timestamp, 'POST', requestPath, "", bodyString);

    const response = await axios.post(url, body, { headers });

    if (response.data.code === '0') {
      return response.data.data[0].gasLimit;
    } else {
      throw new Error(`API Error: ${response.data.msg || 'Unknown error'}`);
    }
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Failed to get gas limit:', (error as Error).message);
    throw error;
  }
}
Method 2: Using RPC to Estimate Gas Limit

The second approach utilizes standard Web3 RPC calls to estimate the required gas for your transaction.

const gasLimit = await web3.eth.estimateGas({
  from: WALLET_ADDRESS,
  to: tokenAddress,
  value: '0',
  data: swapData.data
});

// Add 20% buffer
const gasLimit = (BigInt(gasLimit) * BigInt(12) / BigInt(10)).toString();
Broadcasting Transactions with the Onchain Gateway API

For developers with access to the Onchain Gateway API, you can broadcast transactions directly through OKX's infrastructure. This method provides enhanced reliability and monitoring capabilities for high-volume trading operations.

The Broadcast API requires API is available to our whitelisted customers only. Please reach out to dexapi@okx.com to request access.

import { Web3 } from 'web3';
import axios from 'axios';
import * as dotenv from 'dotenv';
import CryptoJS from 'crypto-js';

// Load environment variables
dotenv.config();

// Connect to Base network
const web3 = new Web3(process.env.EVM_RPC_URL || 'https://mainnet.base.org');

// Your wallet information - REPLACE WITH YOUR OWN VALUES
const WALLET_ADDRESS = process.env.EVM_WALLET_ADDRESS || '';
const PRIVATE_KEY = process.env.EVM_PRIVATE_KEY || '';

// Token addresses for swap on Base Chain
const ETH_ADDRESS = '0xEeeeeEeeeEeEeeEeEeEeeEEEeeeeEeeeeeeeEEeE'; // Native ETH

// Chain ID for Base Chain
const chainId = '8453';

// API URL
const baseUrl = 'https://web3.okx.com/api/v5/';

// Define interfaces
interface GasLimitApiResponse {
  code: string;
  msg?: string;
  data: Array<{
    gasLimit: string;
  }>;
}

// Interface for broadcast API response
interface BroadcastApiResponse {
  code: string;
  msg?: string;
  data: Array<{
    orderId: string;
  }>;
}

Alternative: Broadcasting Transactions Using Standard RPC For developers who prefer using standard blockchain RPC methods or do not have yet requested API whitelisting, you can broadcast transactions directly to the network using Web3 RPC calls.

 * @param toTokenAddress - Destination token address
 * @param amount - Amount to swap
 * @param slippage - Maximum slippage
 * @returns Transaction hash

  // 1. Check allowance and approve if necessary (skip for native token)
  if (fromTokenAddress !== ETH_ADDRESS) {
    await approveToken(fromTokenAddress, amount);
  }

  // 2. Get swap transaction data
  const swapData = await getSwapTransaction(fromTokenAddress, toTokenAddress, amount, WALLET_ADDRESS, slippage);

}
8. Track Transaction#
Choose the first(section 8.1) for basic transaction confirmation status, and the second(section 8.2) when you need detailed information about the swap execution itself.

8.1 Using Onchain gateway API

The Onchain gateway API provides transaction tracking capabilities through the /dex/post-transaction/orders endpoint. Use the order ID returned by the broadcast API to track transactions as they progress through OKX's systems with simple status codes (1: Pending, 2: Success, 3: Failed).

// Define error info interface
interface TxErrorInfo {
  error: string;
  message: string;
  action: string;
}

/**
 * Tracking transaction confirmation status using the Onchain gateway API
 * @param orderId - Order ID from broadcast response
 * @param intervalMs - Polling interval in milliseconds
 * @param timeoutMs - Maximum time to wait
 * @returns Final transaction confirmation status
 */
async function trackTransaction(
  orderId: string,
  intervalMs: number = 5000,
  timeoutMs: number = 300000
): Promise<any> {
  console.log(`Tracking transaction with Order ID: ${orderId}`);

  const startTime = Date.now();
  let lastStatus = '';

  while (Date.now() - startTime < timeoutMs) {
    // Get transaction status
    try {
      const path = 'dex/post-transaction/orders';
      const url = `https://web3.okx.com/api/v5/${path}`;

      const params = {
        orderId: orderId,
        chainIndex: chainId,
        address: WALLET_ADDRESS,
        limit: '1'
      };

      // Prepare authentication
      const timestamp = new Date().toISOString();
      const requestPath = `/api/v5/${path}`;
      const queryString = "?" + new URLSearchParams(params).toString();
      const headers = getHeaders(timestamp, 'GET', requestPath, queryString);

      const response = await axios.get(url, { params, headers });

      if (response.data.code === '0' && response.data.data && response.data.data.length > 0) {
        if (response.data.data[0].orders && response.data.data[0].orders.length > 0) {
          const txData = response.data.data[0].orders[0];
          
          // Use txStatus to match the API response
          const status = txData.txStatus;

          // Only log when status changes
          if (status !== lastStatus) {
            lastStatus = status;

            if (status === '1') {
              console.log(`Transaction pending: ${txData.txHash || 'Hash not available yet'}`);
            } else if (status === '2') {
              console.log(`Transaction successful: https://web3.okx.com/explorer/base/tx/${txData.txHash}`);
              return txData;
            } else if (status === '3') {
              const failReason = txData.failReason || 'Unknown reason';
              const errorMessage = `Transaction failed: ${failReason}`;

              console.error(errorMessage);

              const errorInfo = handleTransactionError(txData);
              console.log(`Error type: ${errorInfo.error}`);

/**
 * Comprehensive error handling with failReason
 * @param txData - Transaction data from post-transaction/orders

 */
function handleTransactionError(txData: any): TxErrorInfo {
  const failReason = txData.failReason || 'Unknown reason';

  // Log the detailed error
  console.error(`Transaction failed with reason: ${failReason}`);

  // Default error handling
  return {
    error: 'TRANSACTION_FAILED',
    message: failReason,
    action: 'Try again or contact support'
  };
}
8.2 Track transaction using SWAP API:

SWAP API transaction tracking provides comprehensive swap execution details using the /dex/aggregator/history endpoint. It offers token-specific information (symbols, amounts), fees paid, and detailed blockchain data. Use this when you need complete swap insight with token-level details.

/**
 * Track transaction using SWAP API
 * @param chainId - Chain ID (e.g., 1 for Ethereum Mainnet)
 * @param txHash - Transaction hash
 * @returns Transaction details
 */
async function trackTransactionWithSwapAPI(chainId: string, txHash: string): Promise<any> {
  try {
    const path = 'dex/aggregator/history';
    const url = `${baseUrl}${path}`;

    const params = {
      chainId: chainId,
      txHash: txHash,
      isFromMyProject: 'true'
    };

    // Prepare authentication
    const timestamp = new Date().toISOString();
    const requestPath = `/api/v5/${path}`;
    const queryString = "?" + new URLSearchParams(params).toString();
    const headers = getHeaders(timestamp, 'GET', requestPath, queryString);

    const response = await axios.get(url, { params, headers });

    if (response.data.code === '0') {
      const txData = response.data.data[0];
      const status = txData.status;

      if (status === 'pending') {
        console.log(`Transaction is still pending: ${txHash}`);
        return { status: 'pending', details: txData };
      } else if (status === 'success') {
        console.log(`Transaction successful!`);
        console.log(`From: ${txData.fromTokenDetails.symbol} - Amount: ${txData.fromTokenDetails.amount}`);
        console.log(`To: ${txData.toTokenDetails.symbol} - Amount: ${txData.toTokenDetails.amount}`);
        console.log(`Transaction Fee: ${txData.txFee}`);
        console.log(`Explorer URL: https://basescan.org/tx/${txHash}`);
        return { status: 'success', details: txData };
      } else if (status === 'failure') {
        console.error(`Transaction failed: ${txData.errorMsg || 'Unknown reason'}`);
        return { status: 'failure', details: txData };
      }
      
      return txData;
    } else {
      throw new Error(`API Error: ${response.data.msg || 'Unknown error'}`);
    }
  } catch (error) {

10. MEV Protection#
MEV Protection with Broadcast Transaction API#
The OKX Broadcast Transaction API provides built-in MEV protection capabilities to help safeguard your transactions from front-running and sandwich attacks. The Broadcast API is available to our whitelisted customers only. Please reach out to dexapi@okx.com to request access.

Disclaimer: Your end-user's transaction can only be covered by the MEV protection feature if you actually utilise OKX Build's API services for that particular transaction. MEV protection is currently an experimental feature provided by third-parties and OKX Build does not guarantee the effectiveness and quality of such MEV protection.

Adding MEV Protection#
To enable MEV protection on EVM chains, add the extraData field to your broadcast transaction request with enableMevProtection: true:

/**
 * Broadcast transaction with MEV protection enabled for EVM chains
 */
async function broadcastTransactionWithMEV(
    signedTx: string,
    chainId: string = "8453", // Base chain
    walletAddress: string,
    enableMevProtection: boolean = true
): Promise<string> {
    try {
        console.log('Broadcasting transaction with MEV protection...');

        const path = 'dex/pre-transaction/broadcast-transaction';
        const url = `https://web3.okx.com/api/v5/${path}`;

        const body = {
            signedTx: signedTx,
            chainIndex: chainId,
            address: walletAddress,
            extraData: JSON.stringify({
                enableMevProtection: enableMevProtection
            })
        };

        const bodyString = JSON.stringify(body);
        const timestamp = new Date().toISOString();
        const requestPath = `/api/v5/${path}`;
        const headers = getHeaders(timestamp, 'POST', requestPath, "", bodyString);

        const response = await axios.post(url, body, { headers });

        if (response.data.code === '0') {
            const orderId = response.data.data[0].orderId;
            console.log(`Transaction broadcast with MEV protection. Order ID: ${orderId}`);
            return orderId;
        } else {
            throw new Error(`Broadcast API Error: ${response.data.msg || 'Unknown error'}`);
        }
    } catch (error) {
        console.error('MEV-protected broadcast failed:', error);
        throw error;
    }
}
Usage Examples#
Basic swap without MEV protection:

// Standard broadcast (no MEV protection) for Base chain
const orderId = await broadcastTransaction(signedTx, "8453", walletAddress);
Swap with MEV protection enabled:

// With MEV protection on Base chain
const orderId = await broadcastTransactionWithMEVOptions(signedTx, "8453", walletAddress, true);
Integration with Complete Swap Flow#
Here's how to integrate MEV protection into your complete EVM swap execution:

/**
 * Execute EVM swap with MEV protection
 */
async function executeSwapWithMEVProtection(
    fromTokenAddress: string,
    toTokenAddress: string,
    amount: string,
    slippage: string = '0.005',
    enableMevProtection: boolean = true,
    chainId: string = "8453" // Base chain
): Promise<string> {
    try {
        // Step 1: Check allowance and approve if necessary (skip for native token)
        if (fromTokenAddress !== ETH_ADDRESS) {
            await approveToken(fromTokenAddress, amount);
        }

        // Step 2: Get swap transaction data
        const swapData = await getSwapTransaction(fromTokenAddress, toTokenAddress, amount, WALLET_ADDRESS, slippage);
        
        const txData = swapData.tx;
        console.log("Swap TX data received");

        // Step 3: Get current gas price and nonce
        const gasPrice = await web3.eth.getGasPrice();
        const adjustedGasPrice = BigInt(gasPrice) * BigInt(15) / BigInt(10); // 1.5x for faster confirmation
        const nonce = await web3.eth.getTransactionCount(WALLET_ADDRESS, 'latest');

        // Step 4: Create and sign transaction object
        const txObject = {
            from: WALLET_ADDRESS,
            to: txData.to,
            data: txData.data,
            value: txData.value || '0',
            gas: '300000', // Default gas limit
            gasPrice: adjustedGasPrice.toString(),
            nonce: nonce
        };

        const signedTx = await web3.eth.accounts.signTransaction(txObject, PRIVATE_KEY);
        console.log("Transaction signed");

        // Step 5: Broadcast with MEV protection
        const orderId = await broadcastTransactionWithMEVOptions(
            signedTx.rawTransaction, 
            chainId, 
            WALLET_ADDRESS, 
            enableMevProtection
        );

        // Step 6: Track transaction
        const result = await trackTransaction(orderId);
        
        return result.txHash;
    } catch (error) {
        console.error("MEV-protected swap failed:", error);
        throw error;
    }
}
The MEV protection feature integrates seamlessly with your existing EVM and Solana swap implementation and provides an additional layer of security against MEV attacks across Solana, Base, Ethereum and BSC.

Method 2: SDK approach#
Using the OKX DEX SDK provides a much simpler developer experience while retaining all the functionality of the API-first approach. The SDK handles many implementation details for you, including retry logic, error handling, and transaction management.

1. Install the SDK#
npm install @okx-dex/okx-dex-sdk
# or
yarn add @okx-dex/okx-dex-sdk
# or
pnpm add @okx-dex/okx-dex-sdk
2. Setup Your Environment#
Create a .env file with your API credentials and wallet information:

# OKX API Credentials
OKX_API_KEY=your_api_key
OKX_SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key
OKX_API_PASSPHRASE=your_passphrase
OKX_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
# EVM Configuration
EVM_RPC_URL=your_evm_rpc_url
EVM_WALLET_ADDRESS=your_evm_wallet_address
EVM_PRIVATE_KEY=your_evm_private_key
3. Initialize the Client#
Create a file for your DEX client (e.g., DexClient.ts):

// DexClient.ts
import { OKXDexClient } from '@okx-dex/okx-dex-sdk';
import { createEVMWallet } from '@okx-dex/okx-dex-sdk/core/evm-wallet';
import { createWallet } from '@okx-dex/okx-dex-sdk/core/wallet';
import { Connection } from '@solana/web3.js';
import { ethers } from 'ethers';
import dotenv from 'dotenv';

dotenv.config();

// EVM setup (Ethereum, Base, Arbitrum, etc.)
const evmProvider = new ethers.JsonRpcProvider(process.env.EVM_RPC_URL!);
const evmWallet = createEVMWallet(process.env.EVM_PRIVATE_KEY!, evmProvider);

// Initialize the client
const client = new OKXDexClient({
    // API credentials (get from OKX Developer Portal)
    apiKey: process.env.OKX_API_KEY!,
    secretKey: process.env.OKX_SECRET_KEY!,
    apiPassphrase: process.env.OKX_API_PASSPHRASE!,
    projectId: process.env.OKX_PROJECT_ID!,
    
    // EVM configuration (works for all EVM chains)
    evm: {
        wallet: evmWallet
    },
})
4. Token Approval With the SDK#
Create an approval utility function:

// approval.ts
import { client } from './DexClient';
// Helper function to convert human-readable amounts to base units
export function toBaseUnits(amount: string, decimals: number): string {
    // Remove any decimal point and count the decimal places
    const [integerPart, decimalPart = ''] = amount.split('.');
    const currentDecimals = decimalPart.length;

    // Combine integer and decimal parts, removing the decimal point
    let result = integerPart + decimalPart;

    // Add zeros if you need more decimal places
    if (currentDecimals < decimals) {

5. Execute a Swap With the SDK#
Create a swap execution file:

// swap.ts
import { client } from './DexClient';
/**
 * Example: Execute a swap from ETH to USDC on Base chain
 */
async function executeSwap() {
  try {
    if (!process.env.EVM_PRIVATE_KEY) {
      throw new Error('Missing EVM_PRIVATE_KEY in .env file');
    }
    // You can change this to any EVM chain
    // For example, for Base, use chainId: '8453'
    // For example, for baseSepolia, use chainId: '84532'
    // You can also use SUI, use chainId: '784'
    // When using another Chain, you need to change the fromTokenAddress and toTokenAddress to the correct addresses for that chain

    const swapResult = await client.dex.executeSwap({
      chainId: '8453', // Base chain ID
      fromTokenAddress: '0xEeeeeEeeeEeEeeEeEeEeeEEEeeeeEeeeeeeeEEeE', // Native ETH
      toTokenAddress: '0x833589fCD6eDb6E08f4c7C32D4f71b54bdA02913', // USDC on Base
      amount: String(10 * 10 ** 14), // .0001 ETH
      slippage: '0.005', // 0.5% slippage
      userWalletAddress: process.env.EVM_WALLET_ADDRESS!
    });
    console.log('Swap executed successfully:');
    console.log(JSON.stringify(swapResult, null, 2));

    return swapResult;
  } catch (error) {
    if (error instanceof Error) {
      console.error('Error executing swap:', error.message);
      // API errors include details in the message
      if (error.message.includes('API Error:')) {
        const match = error.message.match(/API Error: (.*)/);
        if (match) console.error('API Error Details:', match[1]);
      }
    }
    throw error;
  }
}
// Run if this file is executed directly
if (require.main === module) {
  executeSwap()
    .then(() => process.exit(0))
    .catch((error) => {
      console.error('Error:', error);
      process.exit(1);
    });
}
export { executeSwap };
6. Additional SDK Functionality#
The SDK provides additional methods that simplify development:

Get a quote for a token pair

const quote = await client.dex.getQuote({
    chainId: '8453',  // Base Chain
    fromTokenAddress: '0x833589fCD6eDb6E08f4c7C32D4f71b54bdA02913', // USDC
    toTokenAddress: '0x4200000000000000000000000000000000000006', // WETH
    amount: '1000000',  // 1 USDC (in smallest units)
    slippage: '0.005'     // 0.5%
});

Introduction#
OKX DEX is an aggregator of various decentralized exchanges (also known as DEXs, such as Uniswap, Curve, Balancer, etc.) on different blockchains, allowing multi-chain and cross-chain trading. Our goal is to provide users with the best possible prices through intelligent routing.

Comprehensively calculate price, slippage, and transaction costs
Select the best quote for users based on a comprehensive comparison of quotes from various DEXs and PMMs through the smart order splitting algorithm

Get information of the supported networks through /supported/chain.
Get information of the supported tokens through /aggregator/all-tokens.
Build the request for /quote data based on information of the supported networks and tokens.
Following the quote request, obtain the user’s authorization to allow the OKX DEX router to perform asset operations on their wallet.
Build the request for /approve-transaction to get the user’s wallet authorization.
Build /swap information based on the returned quote router data and obtain the transaction data required for the swap.
Broadcast the returned swap transaction information to the blockchain.

swapMode	String	Yes	Possible values: [exactIn, exactOut],Default: exactIn,ExactOut is for supporting use cases where you need an exact output amount. In this case the slippage is on the input token.
fromTokenAddress	String	Yes	The contract address of a token to be sold (e.g., 0xeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee)
toTokenAddress	String	Yes	The contract address of a token to be bought (e.g., 0xa892e1fef8b31acc44ce78e7db0a2dc610f92d00)
dexIds	String	No	DexId of the liquidity pool for limited quotes, multiple combinations separated by , (e.g.,1,50,180, see liquidity list for more)
directRoute	Boolean	No	The default setting is false. When enabled, Direct Routes restrict our routing to a single liquidity pool only. Currently, this feature is only active for Solana swaps.
priceImpactProtectionPercentage	String	No	(Optional. The default is 90%.) The percentage (between 0 - 1.0) of the price impact allowed.

When the priceImpactProtectionPercentage is set, if the estimated price impact is above the percentage indicated, an error will be returned. For example, if PriceImpactProtectionPercentage = .25 (25%), any quote with a price impact higher than 25% will return an error.

This is an optional feature, and the default value is 0.9. When it’s set to 1.0 (100%), the feature will be disabled, which means that every transaction will be allowed to pass.

Note: If we’re unable to calculate the price impact, we’ll return null, and the price impact protection will be disabled.
feePercent	String	No	The percentage of fromTokenAmount will be sent to the referrer's address, the rest will be set as the input amount to be sold. min percentage> 0
max percentage： 10 for Solana, 3 for all other chains
By configuring this parameter, you can obtain the final amount of totoken provided to the user after deducting the commission from fromtoken.
A maximum of two decimal places is allowed. If more decimals are entered, the system will automatically round up.

Get Solana Swap Instructions#
Obtain transaction instruction data for redemption or custom assembly in Solana.

Request URL#
GET https://web3.okx.com/api/v5/dex/aggregator/swap-instruction

Request Parameters#
Parameter	Type	Required	Description
chainIndex	String	Yes	Unique identifier for the chain.
e.g., 501: Solana.
See more here.
chainId	String	Yes	Unique identifier for the chain.
It will be deprecated in the future.
amount	String	Yes	Token amount for the quote.
(The amount must include its precision. For example, exchanging 1.00 USDT requires inputting 1000000, while exchanging 1.00 DAI requires 1000000000000000000. Token precision can be obtained from the token list.)
fromTokenAddress	String	Yes	Address of the token contract being swapped from (e.g., 0xeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee).
toTokenAddress	String	Yes	Address of the token contract being swapped to (e.g., 0xa0b86991c6218b36c1d19d4a2e9eb0ce3606eb48).
slippage	String	Yes	Slippage limit.
Note:
On Solana, the minimum is 0, and the maximum must be less than 1.
(e.g., 0.005 means a max slippage of 0.5%, 1 means 100%).
autoSlippage	Boolean	No	Default is false. When set to true, the original slippage (if set) will be covered by the autoSlippage and the API will calculate and return auto slippage recommendations based on current market data.
maxAutoSlippage	String	No	When autoSlippage is set to true, this value is the maximum auto slippage returned by the API. We recommend that users adopt this value to ensure risk control.
userWalletAddress	String	Yes	User’s wallet address (e.g., 0x3f6a3f57569358a512ccc0e513f171516b0fd42a).
swapReceiverAddress	String	No	Recipient address for the purchased asset. If not set, the asset will be sent to the userWalletAddress. (e.g., 0x3f6a3f57569358a512ccc0e513f171516b0fd42a).
feePercent	String	No	Percentage of the fromToken or toToken amount sent to the referral address. Minimum: 0%, Maximum: 10%, supports up to two decimal places (e.g., input 1.326%, but only 1.32% will be used).
fromTokenReferrerWalletAddress	String	No	Wallet address receiving the referral fee in fromToken.
Must be used with feePercent, and a single transaction can only apply either fromToken or toToken referral fees.

Note:
Solana: The referral address must hold some SOL for activation.
toTokenReferrerWalletAddress	String	No	Wallet address receiving the referral fee in toToken.
Must be used with feePercent, and a single transaction can only apply either fromToken or toToken referral fees.

Note:
Solana: The referral address must hold some SOL for activation.
positiveSlippagePercent	String	No	Positive slippage represents the additional tokens received by the users above the quoted amount. By default, positive slippage is returned fully to the user.
positiveSlippagePercent represents the maximum percentage of those additional tokens that can be retained by the integrator as revenue.
Currently, this parameter is only supported on the Solana chain. For all other chains, any positive slippage will be fully returned to the user.
The default setting is 0. Min percentage: 0 ,Max percentage: 10 , Maximum of 1 decimal point.
positiveSlippageFeeAddress	string	No	The wallet address that receives positive slippage. You must set positiveSlippagePercent parameter together to specify the proportion. If provided, all positive slippage earnings will be sent to this address; if not provided, the wallet address used for collecting referral fees will be used instead.
dexIds	String	No	Restrict the quote to specific liquidity pools by dexId. Multiple IDs should be comma-separated (e.g., 1,50,180. See liquidity list for more details).
directRoute	Boolean	No	The default setting is false. When enabled, Direct Routes restrict our routing to a single liquidity pool only. Currently, this feature is only active for Solana swaps.
priceImpactProtectionPercentage	String	No	(Optional, default: 90%) Allowed price impact percentage (between 0 and 1.0).

If the estimated price impact exceeds the specified percentage, an error will be returned.
Example: If priceImpactProtectionPercentage = 0.25 (25%), any quote exceeding 25% price impact will return an error.

This is an optional feature, defaulting to 0.9. Setting it to 1.0 (100%) disables this protection, allowing all trades to proceed.

Note: If price impact cannot be calculated, it will return null, and this feature will be disabled.
computeUnitPrice	String	No	Used for transactions on the Solana network and similar to gasPrice on Ethereum. This price determines the priority level of the transaction. The higher the price, the more likely that the transaction can be processed faster.
computeUnitLimit	String	No	Used for transactions on the Solana network and analogous to gasLimit on Ethereum, which ensures that the transaction won’t take too much computing resource.

Swap 

Swap#
Generate the data to call the OKX DEX router to execute a swap.

Note
In Uni v3 pools, the following scenario may occur:
If the liquidity for the desired token pair in the pool is depleted, the pool will only consume part of the payment token, leaving a remainder.
As a fully decentralized smart contract, the OKX DEX Router will automatically refund the remainder.
During your integration, please ensure compatibility with this scenario by configuring your contract to support token refunds, thereby ensuring a smooth user experience.

computeUnitPrice	String	No	Used for transactions on the Solana network and similar to gasPrice on Ethereum. This price determines the priority level of the transaction. The higher the price, the more likely that the transaction can be processed faster.
computeUnitLimit	String	No	Used for transactions on the Solana network and analogous to gasLimit on Ethereum, which ensures that the transaction won’t take too much computing resource.
If the parameter tips is not 0, then computeUnitPrice should be set to 0. Otherwise, the fee is wasted.
tips	String	No	Jito tips in SOL. The maximum is "2" and the minimum is "0.0000000001".
This is used for MEV protection. Specify tips to obtain calldata and call the broadcast transaction API。

Here’s a concise “Swap” primer plus a ready-to-run EVM example that calls /dex/aggregator/swap and broadcasts via standard RPC. It follows the required flow: get swap data → estimate gas → sign → send. Add your own ERC-20 approval step before calling swap when fromToken is not the native token.

Key notes

Use chainIndex (preferred) instead of chainId where possible.
swapMode: exactIn (default) or exactOut. exactOut currently supports Ethereum, Base, BSC, Arbitrum and only Uni v2/v3 routes; slippage applies to the input token in exactOut mode.
Uni v3 can refund unspent input when liquidity is partially consumed—ensure your integration can handle token refunds.
For more accurate gas, you can also call OKX gas-limit API; the example below uses provider.estimateGas for simplicity.
If you use feePercent, you must also set either fromTokenReferrerWalletAddress or toTokenReferrerWalletAddress (and only one side per swap).

Common pitfalls checklist

Approvals: If fromToken is an ERC-20 (not the native token sentinel), approve the OKX DEX spender first via /approve-transaction.
Amount units: Always send minimal units (wei, smallest token units).
Slippage: Use 0..1; autoSlippage can override slippage if enabled.
exactOut: Only on Ethereum, Base, BSC, Arbitrum and via Uni v2/v3; set swapMode=exactOut and expect maxSpendAmount in the response.
Refunds on Uni v3: Your app should tolerate unspent-input refunds.
Price impact protection: Set priceImpactProtectionPercentage to fail early when impact > threshold.
MEV/priority: If you need MEV protection, use OKX broadcast with MEV options (whitelisted feature). For Solana, use computeUnitPrice/computeUnitLimit and Jito tips via tips.

Adding Fees#
The OKX DEX API supports configuring referral fees and fee-receiving addresses for token swaps

You can extend the implementation to include fee parameters in your swap quotes and charge up to 3% per swap from your users for most supported networks; while for Solana you can charge up to 10% per swap.

The OKX DEX API plans to take a certain percentage of the referral fee charged by you to your users. For details, please visit the API fee page.

// Extended quoteParams with fee support
const quoteParams = {
    chainId: SOLANA_CHAIN_ID,
    amount: rawAmount,
    fromTokenAddress,
    toTokenAddress,
    slippage: "0.005", // 0.5% slippage
    userWalletAddress: userAddress,
    // Fee-related parameters
    fromTokenReferrerWalletAddress: "Your_REFERRER_WALLET_ADDRESS", // Optional: fee receiving address based on fromToken
    toTokenReferrerWalletAddress: "Your_REFERRER_WALLET_ADDRESS", // Optional: fee receiving address based on toToken
    feePercent: "1.5",  // Optional: referrer fee percentage (max 9 decimal points)

} as Record<string, string>;
Important Fee Configuration Notes for feePercent parameter:

Min percentage > 0. Max percentage: 10 for Solana, 3 for all other chains
Maximum 9 decimal points, E.g. 1.3269018736% is the actual input, but the final calculation will only adopt 1.326901873%
For Solana, the fee receiving address must have some SOL deposited for activation
Each transaction can only choose referrer fee from either the fromToken or the toToken
Example Usage with Fees:

// .. Previous code implementation
    // Get swap quote
    const quoteParams = {
        chainId: SOLANA_CHAIN_ID,
        amount: rawAmount,
        fromTokenAddress,
        toTokenAddress,
        slippage: "0.005", // 0.5% slippage
        userWalletAddress: userAddress,

        // Additional Fee params
        fromTokenReferrerWalletAddress: "fee-recipient-wallet-address",
        feePercent: "1",

        // The wallet addresses to receive the referrer fee (Each transaction can only choose referrer fee from either the fromToken or the toToken)
        // toTokenReferrerWalletAddress: "Fee receiving address,
        // fromTokenReferrerWalletAddress: "Fee receiving address",

    } as Record<string, string>;

    const timestamp = new Date().toISOString();
    const requestPath = "/api/v5/dex/aggregator/swap";
    const queryString = "?" + new URLSearchParams(quoteParams).toString();
    const headers = getHeaders(timestamp, "GET", requestPath, queryString);

    const response = await fetch(
        `https://web3.okx.com${requestPath}${queryString}`,
        { method: "GET", headers }
    );

    const data = await response.json();

    // .. Continue code implementation
Command Line Usage with Fees:

# Example: Swap .01 SOL to USDC with 1.5% referrer fee 
npx ts-node swap.ts .01 11111111111111111111111111111111 EPjFWdd5AufqSSqeM2qN1xzybapC8G4wEGGkZwyTDt1v --referrer YOUR_FEE_RECEIVING_ADDRESS --fee 1.5
Fee Calculation Example: For a trade of 100 USDC with a 1.5% fee:

Fee amount: 1.5 USDC (1.5% of 100 USDC)
Actual swap amount: 98.5 USDC
The fee (1.5 USDC) will be sent to the fee receiving address

FAQ

FAQ#
What Is the Native Token Address for Each Chain?#
We have defined the native tokens for each chain. Please refer to the table below for details:

Chain Name	Native Token Address
EVM	0xeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
Solana	11111111111111111111111111111111
Sui	0x2::sui::SUI
Tron	T9yD14Nj9j7xAB4dbGeiX9h8unkKHxuWwb
Ton	EQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAM9c
What Is “Transfer amount exceeds allowance”?#
This error message indicates that the amount you're trying to transfer exceeds the approved limit. Set your approval limit higher than the amount you wish to transfer to resolve this error.

What Is “min return not reached”?#
This means that the expected minimum return was not met during trade execution. This usually happens when there is a significant slippage or high market volatility. If the expected minimum return is not met, the trade will not be executed. You may increase slippage to raise the chances of the order going through as a higher slippage allows a greater price fluctuation at execution. However, please note that too high a slippage may lead to results that are worse than expected.

Which Tokens Require an Approval Transaction?#
EVM + Tron: Typically, non-native tokens (such as ERC-20/TRC-20 tokens on Ethereum or Tron) require an approval transaction. This ensures that you are allowing the smart contract to transfer these tokens from your account.
Other heterogeneous chains: On some other chains, such as Solana, approval transactions are not required for tokens.

Market API#
Our Market API is a suite of high-performance Restful JSON endpoints and real-time websocket channels to provide comprehensive multi-market and onchain data for cryptocurrency tokens, trades, transactions, accounts and more, pulling information from hundreds of decentralized exchanges (DEX) and centralized exchanges (CEX) across different blockchain ecosystems.

Developers can utilize the Market API and the Trade API to build complete DEX experience with insightful market and portfolio dashboards, allowing users to monitor token performance across different exchange types in real-time, analyze portfolio changes and identify trading opportunities.

Market price API
Retrieves the latest price data, recent transactions and candlestick charts of a token, in REST API and Websocket.
Index price API
Provides the index prices for native and other tokens calculated from the prices of multiple third-party data sources.
Balance API
Queries the balance of a specific token or all tokens under an address across multiple chains or specified chains.
Transaction history API
Retrieve details of a transaction based on txHash or all transaction history under an address.

Purpose and coverage

High-performance REST and real-time WebSocket interfaces.
Aggregates multi-market and on-chain data from hundreds of DEXs and CEXs across multiple chains.
Complements the Trade API to enable full DEX experiences (real-time monitoring, portfolio analytics, opportunity discovery).
Delivery methods

RESTful JSON endpoints.
WebSocket channels for real-time streams.
Main capability groups

Market price API: Latest price, recent transactions (trades), and candlestick charts for tokens via REST and WebSocket.
Index price API: Index prices for native and other tokens computed from multiple third-party data sources.
Balance API: Token balances for a given address, either per-chain or across multiple chains.
Transaction history API: Transaction details by txHash or complete history for an address.
Typical use cases

Real-time token performance dashboards across DEX/CEX.
Portfolio views and historical PnL tracking across chains.
Alerts and strategy backtesting using recent trades and candles.
Data enrichment for swap UIs (price, index, balances, and tx lookups).
Done. Share the specific endpoint specs (URLs, params, auth, examples, and any rate limits/error codes) for Market Price, Index Price, Balance, and Transaction History, and I’ll proceed.

Login#
Request Parameters#
Parameter	Type	Required	Description
op	String	Yes	Operation, login
args	Array	Yes	List of subscribed channels
> apiKey	String	Yes	API Key
> passphrase	String	Yes	API Key password
> timestamp	String	Yes	Unix Epoch time, the unit is seconds
> sign	String	Yes	Signature string
Response Parameters#
Parameter	Type	Description
event	String	Operation.login or error
code	String	Error code
msg	String	Error message
connId	String	WebSocket connection ID
apiKey: Unique identification for invoking API. Requires users to apply one manually in the developer portal.

passphrase: API Key password

timestamp: the Unix Epoch time, the unit is seconds, e.g. 1704876947

sign: signature string, the signature algorithm is as follows:

First concatenate timestamp, method, requestPath, strings, then use HMAC SHA256 method to encrypt the concatenated string with SecretKey, and then perform Base64 encoding.

secretKey: The security key generated when the user applies for API Key, e.g. : 22582BD0CFF14C41EDBF1AB98506286D

Example of timestamp: const timestamp = '' + Date.now() / 1,000
Among sign example: sign=CryptoJS.enc.Base64.stringify(CryptoJS.HmacSHA256(timestamp +'GET'+'/users/self/verify', secretKey))
method: always 'GET'.
requestPath: always '/users/self/verify'


Tips
The request will expire 30 seconds after the timestamp. If your server time differs from the API server time, we recommend using the REST API to query the API server time and then set the timestamp.

Here’s a concise, ready-to-use guide and sample clients for subscribing to the Candlesticks WebSocket channel.

Key points

Channel: candlesticks (no auth required)
Operation: op = "subscribe" (or "unsubscribe")
Args: channel, chainIndex, tokenContractAddress
Push rate: up to 1 update per second
Data shape: data is an array of arrays, each candle entry is [ts, o, h, l, c, vol, volUsd, confirm]
confirm: 0 = in-progress, 1 = completed
EVM addresses must be lowercase
Total subscription payload size across channels <= 64 KB
Use the WebSocket URL provided by OKX (contact dexapi@okx.com). Set it via an environment variable in these examples.
Example subscribe payload { "op": "subscribe", "args": [ { "channel": "dex-token-candle1s", "chainIndex": "1", "tokenContractAddress": "0x382bb369d343125bfb2117af9c149795c6c65c50" } ] }

Example unsubscribe payload { "op": "unsubscribe", "args": [ { "channel": "dex-token-candle1s", "chainIndex": "1", "tokenContractAddress": "0x382bb369d343125bfb2117af9c149795c6c65c50" } ] }

Node.js (TypeScript) example using ws


okx-dex-candles.ts
import WebSocket from "ws";

type ChannelArg = {
  channel:
    | "dex-token-candle1s" | "dex-token-candle1m" | "dex-token-candle3m" | "dex-token-candle5m"
    | "dex-token-candle15m" | "dex-token-candle30m" | "dex-token-candle1H" | "dex-token-candle2H"
Python (asyncio) example


okx_dex_candles.py
import asyncio
import json
import os
from datetime import datetime, timezone

import websockets
Notes and tips

No authentication needed for candlestick channels (K-line). Price and trade channels require login first.
Chain index: 1 = Ethereum (example). Use the official ChainIndex list for other networks.
EVM contract addresses must be lowercase to avoid errors.
A candle with confirm=0 is in-progress; only consider confirm=1 as finalized.
Error handling: e.g., you may see code 60012 for invalid request formatting in a WS error event.
The “first” candle in any request window may be incomplete. For chart continuity, use the previous close as the next open as per REST docs.
Ensure total subscription payload size stays below 64 KB if subscribing to many channels/tokens.
If you’d like, tell me your target chainIndex, token address, and preferred intervals, and I can tailor the code to your exact subscriptions.

X Layer overview#
X Layer is a cutting-edge Ethereum layer 2 (L2) network built by OKX and Polygon using Polygon's CDK. It offers full compatibility with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), enabling developers to deploy existing Ethereum applications and develop new, innovative projects at a fraction of the cost compared to doing so on Ethereum. X Layer also enables users to use dapps at significantly lower gas fees and faster speed compared to Ethereum.

X Layer's underlying architecture is that of a zkEVM validium, which means that transactions are secured via ZK proofs. This architecture is a close sibling of ZK rollup, but it offers the following advantages over rollups:

Significantly lower fees, since they don't consume expensive Ethereum gas, i.e., blockspace to store transaction data.
Significantly higher scalability, since rollups’ throughput is bounded by the amount of transaction data that can be published to Ethereum.
For more detailed information, you can check out the X Layer architecture below.

X Layer architecture#
The major components of X Layer are:

Virtual Machine: zkEVM
Mode: Validium
Data Availability: Data Availability Committee (DAC)
Consensus: X Layer PoE contract (ZkEVM.sol
)
Sequencer: Trusted
Gas token: OKB
X Layer Architecture

X Layer Validium#
X Layer is built with Polygon CDK, an advanced open-source framework designed for the rapid deployment of ZK-powered layer 2 (L2) blockchains on Ethereum
.

X Layer adopts the validium mode, and implements a dedicated committee of sequencers, to maintain seamless interoperability with all other Polygon chains, delivering a high performance L2 scaling solution.

Since transaction data is not stored on the Ethereum mainnet, it is both executed and stored off-chain, which can lead to a massive enhancement in scalability. In the premise of ensuring security, Validium can reduce L1 gas storage costs, hence reducing transaction costs for users on L2, with a prominent enhancement in user privacy and user experience.

Similar to zero-knowledge rollups (ZK-rollups), X Layer confirms off-chain transactions on the Ethereum network. This approach prevents incorrect state changes and boosts the security of the X Layer network.

ZKValidium vs. ZKRollups#
zkValidiums differ from rollups and sidechains because they only share the proof of validity, which confirms the results of the transactions with Ethereum, not the actual transaction data of the executed transactions. Here is how it operates: a verifier smart contract is deployed on Ethereum, and validium submits proof of validity to this contract. These proofs are zero knowledge in nature and contain transaction outcomes but not the specific transaction data.

The verifier smart contract assesses the validity of the proof. If it is found to be invalid, any batch submitted by the validium is rejected and not stored on Ethereum.

ZKValidium vs. ZKRollup

Consensus contract#
ZkEVM.sol is the underlying protocol that guarantees the correctness of state changes through the use of validity proof. To confirm that specific predefined rules have been adhered to for permitting state transitions, the Consensus contract (ZkEVM.sol, deployed on Ethereum layer 1) comes into play.

ZkEVM.sol is responsible for verifying validity proofs to confirm that each transition has been executed correctly, utilizing ZK-SNARK circuits for verification. To make this system work, two key processes are involved: transaction batching and transaction validation. To perform these procedures, X Layer involves two types of participants: sequencers and aggregators.

Sequencer: it is responsible for proposing transaction batches to the network, essentially grouping transaction requests and adding them to the ZkEVM.sol.

Aggregator: it is responsible for reviewing the transaction batches’ validity and providing the necessary proofs of validity. Any permissionless aggregator can submit these proofs to demonstrate the accuracy of the state transition computation.

Consensus Contract Flow

Data Availability#
X Layer operates in validium mode, where it integrates a secure data availability layer managed by a DAC. Below are the functionalities of DAC:

Verifies the availability of data associated with specific blockchain blocks
Ensures data robustness and computational efficiency of X Layer
Advantages of the DAC provided by Polygon CDK#
The DAC primarily provides:

Lower transaction fees: less computations leads to lower fees
State privacy: maintaining a secure state change record to ensure data integrity
Note
Check out Ethereum Foundation’s Data availibilty
 and Polygon CDK’s Data availability
 for more info on DAC.
ZKNode#
ZKNode is a client used to sync with the state of X Layer. Trusted sequencer and trusted aggregator are responsible for managing the L2 state and its finality on L1. The following ZKNode architecture shows the flow of state updates.

ZKNode Architecture

Note
For more information on ZKNode, you can visit Polygon ZKNode
.
ZKProver#
As an Ethereum scaling solution, X Layer simulates the Ethereum Virtual Machine to provide users with the same Ethereum experience while inheriting the security of the Ethereum mainnet.

X Layer employs a zero-knowledge prover component called ZKProver to generate validity proofs for ZKRollup. The ZKProver is expected to leverage accelerators such as GPU, FPGA, and ASIC to reduce proof time and cost significantly.

The general operational process is as follows: ZKProver receives a batch of many transactions from nodes and generates a concise zero-knowledge proof using state-of-the-art ZK tools and technology. This not only substantially reduces the time for final transaction confirmation but also significantly lowers users’ Gas consumption costs. The specific interaction flow can be referred to in the following diagram:

ZKProver Control Flow

ZKNode sends the content of the Merkle tree to the database for storage.
Then, ZK nodes send a batch of many transactions to the ZKProver component.
ZKProver accesses the database and retrieves the necessary information to generate verifiable proofs for the transactions sent by the nodes. This information includes Merkle roots, the keys and hashes of relevant siblings, and more.
Finally, ZKProver generates proofs for the transactions and sends them back to the ZK node.
Note
For more information on how ZKProver creates verifiable transaction proofs, you can visit Polygon ZKProver Overview
.
Tokenomics#
There are two main actors on X Layer that earn OKB as reward and pay OKB token as Gas fee for transactions at the same time.

Sequencers#
Each sequencer is required to pay a fee in OKB tokens to have the privilege of creating and suggesting batches.
When a sequencer successfully proposes valid batches containing valid transactions, they are rewarded with the fees paid by transaction requestors or network users.
Aggregators#
Aggregators validate transactions proposed and batched by sequencers.
Aggregators need to run on X Layer’s ZKNode software, and create zero-knowledge validity proofs utilizing ZKProver.
For each validity proof submitted, aggregators earn the OKB fee, which is paid by the sequencer(s) of the batch(es).
Aggregators compete to produce validity proofs based on their strategies and intentions to validate transactions.
Transactions on X Layer#
Before making any transactions on layer 2, users need to have some OKB token on X Layer to perform any layer 2 transaction. To get OKB on layer 2, users need to transfer some OKB from L1 to L2 through X Layer bridge.

Visit Bridge user guide for detailed steps to transfer OKB from L1 to layer 2.
Layer 2 transactions：
The user starts a transaction from their wallet (e.g., MetaMask) and sends it to a sequencer.
Once the sequencer commits to adding the transaction, it becomes finalized on layer 2.
At this point, the transaction is settled on layer 2, but its state has not yet propagated to L1. This state is known as the trusted state.
The sequencer transmits the batch data to a smart contract on L1, permitting any node to synchronize its state from L1 in a secure, trustless manner. This state is referred to as the virtual state.
The aggregator gathers pending transactions for verification and constructs a proof to attain finality on L1.
After the proof undergoes validation, the user’s transactions gain finality on L1, a crucial step for actions like withdrawals. This state is called the verified state.
To get a sense of the complete transaction life cycle on X Layer, we recommend you to take a look at the Transactions and data flow document.

Validium vs rollup: Publishes ZK validity proofs to Ethereum without posting full transaction data, yielding significantly lower fees and higher scalability (throughput not bounded by L1 data publishing).
Architecture:
VM: zkEVM; Mode: Validium; DA: Data Availability Committee (DAC)
Consensus: ZkEVM.sol (L1 verifier/consensus contract) verifies ZK-SNARK validity proofs
Roles: Trusted sequencer (batches txs) and permissionless aggregators (generate/submit proofs)
Sequencer: proposes transaction batches to ZkEVM.sol
Aggregator: validates batches and submits validity proofs
Sequencer is trusted; gas token on X Layer is OKB
Validium specifics:
Off-chain execution and data storage improve scalability and privacy while reducing L1 gas
Verifier contract on L1 accepts/rejects batches based on proof validity
Data Availability (DAC):
Verifies availability of block-associated data
Enhances robustness and efficiency
Advantages: lower fees, state privacy
ZKNode:
Client to sync X Layer state; coordinates with trusted sequencer/aggregator for L2 state and L1 finality
ZKProver:
Generates validity proofs for batched transactions; can leverage GPU/FPGA/ASIC
Flow: ZKNode stores Merkle data → sends batched txs to ZKProver → Prover fetches Merkle roots/siblings/etc. → returns proofs to ZKNode
Tokenomics:
Gas and rewards in OKB
Sequencers pay OKB to propose batches and earn users’ fees on valid batches
Aggregators run ZKNode/ZKProver, submit proofs, and earn OKB fees paid by sequencers; they compete to produce proofs
Transactions lifecycle:
Users need OKB on L2; bridge OKB from L1 via X Layer bridge
States: trusted (L2 finalized), virtual (batch data posted to L1 for trustless sync), verified (proof validated on L1; enables withdrawals)

Network information#
Welcome to X Layer developer documentation.

X Layer is a ZKEVM Layer 2 network built on Ethereum, powered by Polygon CDK
 — a ZKEVM stack for building Ethereum layer 2 scaling solutions. Developers can easily deploy their existing contracts on ZKEVM, and users can move their assets from Ethereum and conduct transactions off-chain. These transactions are bundled into groups with a zero-knowledge proof to verify their validity.

Why build on X Layer?#
Boundless scalability: enable ZK-powered DApps on X Layer, with 100% EVM compatibility and easy-to-use developer tools for deployment
Powered by OKX: seamless OKX product integrations, all-in-one Web3 gateway, and access to 50M+ users in the OKX ecosystem
Security: rely on robust secure mechanisms from Ethereum, with trustless interoperability
Low fee: same coding experience as Ethereum, with 100x less in costs
Portal to Web3: enter the world of Web3 via OKX Wallet, built with compact infrastructure modules to create innovative DApps
Powered by Polygon: ZKEVM Layer 2 based on Polygon CDK, ensuring near-instant finality, unified liquidity, and independent data availability
What’s the difference between building on X Layer vs. Ethereum for developers?#
Building DApps on X Layer is just like building them on Ethereum. All you have to do is switch to the X Layer RPC and begin your development on X Layer, that offers faster transactions, lower costs, and robust security. X Layer offers a user experience similar to the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) for both developers and users. This means you won’t need any new tools or wallets to create or use DApps on ZKEVM.

Note
You can visit Polygon’s Differences between EVM and ZKEVM
 for detailed differences in terms of supported EIPs, opcodes, and additional changes to build on ZKEVM.
Acquiring testnet OKB#
To start building on X Layer, you’ll first need some testnet OKB. See the Faucet guide for the steps to get testnet OKB on X Layer.

Connecting to X Layer (Mainnet)#
You can add X Layer mainnet by inputting the following network info:

Properties	Network details
Network name	X Layer mainnet
RPC URL	https://rpc.xlayer.tech
Chain ID	196
Token symbol	OKB
Block explorer URL	https://www.okx.com/web3/explorer/xlayer
Connecting to X Layer (Testnet)#
You can add X Layer testnet by inputting the following network info:

Properties	Network details
Network name	X Layer testnet
RPC URL	https://testrpc.xlayer.tech
Chain ID	195
Token symbol	OKB
Block explorer URL	https://www.okx.com/web3/explorer/xlayer-test
You can connect to the X Layer Testnet through the RPC service provider ZAN Node
 or simply add X Layer Testnet to MetaMask through Chainlist

The next step is to bridge your assets from Ethereum → X Layer. You can use the X Layer Bridge to bridge your assets.

Deploying smart contracts#
Developing on X Layer is seamless and identical to Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). Developers can use their existing code and toolings to deploy on X Layer with much better performance and lower fees. Check out how to deploy smart contracts on X Layer:

Deploying with Hardhat#
In this tutorial, we explain step-by-step how to create, compile and deploy a simple smart contract on the X Layer testnet using Hardhat.

What is Hardhat#
Hardhat is a development environment to compile, deploy, test, and debug your smart contract.

Setting up the development environment#
Prerequisites:

Node.js v18+ LTS and npm
 (comes with Node)
Git
To install Hardhat, you need to create an npm project by going to an empty folder, running npm init, and following its instructions. You can use another package manager, like yarn, but we recommend you use npm 7 or later, as it makes installing Hardhat plugins simpler.

Once your project is ready, you should run npm install --save-dev hardhat , install Hardhat toolbox npm install @nomicfoundation/hardhat-toolbox . In order to use your local installation of Hardhat, you need to use npx to run it (i.e., npx hardhat).

Creating your contract#
To create the sample project, run npx hardhat in your project folder:

$ npx hardhat
888    888                      888 888               888

Compiling your contract#
Next, if you take a look at the contracts/ folder, you will see Lock.sol:

// SPDX-License-Identifier: UNLICENSED
pragma solidity ^0.8.9;

// Uncomment this line to use console.log
// import "hardhat/console.sol";

contract Lock {
    uint public unlockTime;
    address payable public owner;

    event Withdrawal(uint amount, uint when);

    constructor(uint _unlockTime) payable {
        require(
            block.timestamp < _unlockTime,
            "Unlock time should be in the future"
        );

        unlockTime = _unlockTime;
        owner = payable(msg.sender);
    }

    function withdraw() public {
        // Uncomment this line, and the import of "hardhat/console.sol", to print a log in your terminal
        // console.log("Unlock time is %o and block timestamp is %o", unlockTime, block.timestamp);

        require(block.timestamp >= unlockTime, "You can't withdraw yet");
        require(msg.sender == owner, "You aren't the owner");

        emit Withdrawal(address(this).balance, block.timestamp);

        owner.transfer(address(this).balance);
    }
}
To compile it, simply run npx hardhat compile

Setting configuration file#
In order to connect to the X Layer network, we need to configure the corresponding network. To set up your config, you have to export an object from hardhat.config.js:

module.exports = {
  defaultNetwork: "hardhat",
  networks: {
    hardhat: {
    },
    xlayer: {
      url: "https://testrpc.xlayer.tech",
      accounts: [privateKey1, privateKey2, ...]
    }
  }
}
Deploying your contract#
Next, to deploy the contract, we will use a Hardhat script. Inside the scripts/ folder you will find a file with the following code:

// We require the Hardhat Runtime Environment explicitly here. This is optional
// but useful for running the script in a standalone fashion through `node <script>`.
//
// You can also run a script with `npx hardhat run <script>`. If you do that, Hardhat
// will compile your contracts, add the Hardhat Runtime Environment's members to the
// global scope, and execute the script.
const hre = require("hardhat");

async function main() {
  const currentTimestampInSeconds = Math.round(Date.now() / 1000);
  const unlockTime = currentTimestampInSeconds + 60;

  const lockedAmount = hre.ethers.utils.parseEther("0.001");

  const Lock = await hre.ethers.getContractFactory("Lock");
  const lock = await Lock.deploy(unlockTime, { value: lockedAmount });

  await lock.deployed();

  console.log(
    `Lock with ${ethers.utils.formatEther(
      lockedAmount
    )}ETH and unlock timestamp ${unlockTime} deployed to ${lock.address}`
  );
}

// We recommend this pattern to be able to use async/await everywhere
// and properly handle errors.
main().catch((error) => {
  console.error(error);
  process.exitCode = 1;
});
Now, you can run it using npx hardhat run:

$ npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network XLayer
Lock with 1 ETH deployed to: 0x5FbDB2315678afecb367f032d93F642f64180aa3

Deploying with Hardhat (X Layer testnet)

Purpose: Step-by-step to create, compile, and deploy a simple contract on X Layer testnet using Hardhat.
Prereqs: Node.js v18+ (npm 7+ recommended), Git.
Install:
npm i -D hardhat
npm i -D @nomicfoundation/hardhat-toolbox
Use npx hardhat to run.
Sample project: npx hardhat → choose “Create a JavaScript project”.
Example contract: contracts/Lock.sol (solc ^0.8.9); compile with npx hardhat compile.
Network config (testnet):
hardhat.config.js example:
networks.xlayer.url: https://testrpc.xlayer.tech
networks.xlayer.accounts: [privateKey1, privateKey2, ...] (strings; typically loaded from env)
Deploy script (scripts/deploy.js):
Uses hre.ethers to get factory and deploy Lock with a small value.
Awaits lock.deployed(); logs address.
Run deployment:
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network XLayer
Breadcrumb: Developers > Build on X Layer > Deploy a smart contract > Deploying with Hardhat
Notes/pitfalls spotted

Network name case mismatch: config shows networks.xlayer but CLI uses --network XLayer. They must match exactly (e.g., use --network xlayer or rename key to XLayer).
accounts values should be quoted hex private keys (0x...) and usually injected via dotenv, not bare identifiers.
Script mixes hre.ethers.utils.parseEther and ethers.utils.formatEther; ensure consistent usage (either both via hre.ethers or import ethers).
Depending on ethers version: lock.deployed() (ethers v5) vs await lock.waitForDeployment() (ethers v6). Match your toolbox/ethers versions.
Fund your deployer on X Layer testnet with OKB from the faucet.

You said: Verifying with Hardhat# There are currently two methods
Verifying with Hardhat#
There are currently two methods to verify your code on OKLink
. You can either use the recommended @okxweb3/hardhat-explorer-verify
 plugin, or modify the hardhat.config.js file according to Hardhat's official documentation
.

Important notes#
First, you need to apply for a key in OKLink browser
.
After you deploy your contract code, make sure to wait at least one minute before verifying it.
Verify by using plugin (Recommended)#
Example#
First, install the plugin in your Hardhat project by using the following command:
npm install @okxweb3/hardhat-explorer-verify

In your Hardhat configuration file (usually hardhat.config.js or hardhat.config.ts), import and configure the plugin. ensure that your network configuration and API keys are correctly set. Here is a sample configuration:
import "@nomicfoundation/hardhat-toolbox";
import '@okxweb3/hardhat-explorer-verify';  // Import the plugin

const config: HardhatUserConfig = {
  solidity: "0.8.20",
  sourcify: {
    enabled: true,
  },
  networks: {
    xlayer: {
      url: "https://xlayerrpc.example.com",
      accounts: ["<Your Wallet Private Key>"],
    },
  },
  etherscan: {
     apiKey: '...'
  },
  okxweb3explorer: {
    apiKey: "<Your API Key>",
  }
};

export default config;
After deploying the contracts, use Hardhat to run the verification script. This typically involves running a specific Hardhat task that automatically fetches the contract data and submitting it to the OKX Chain explorer for verification. Here is an example command:
npx hardhat okverify --network xlayer <Your Contract Address>

Once verification is successful, you can view the verification status and the contract code on the OKX Chain blockchain explorer.
Verify with OKX plugin

Verify TransparentUpgradeableProxy contract
An example command:

npx hardhat okxverify --network xlayer --contract <Contract>:<Name> --proxy <address>

--proxy refers to the proxy contract address.
Note
If you are using 897 Contract, you do not need to add --proxy. Instead, replace it with --contract.
Verify by modifying hardhat.config.js (Alternative)#
Example#
Start by creating a Hardhat project and using the Lock contract as an example.
Next, modify the hardhat.config.js file in your project directory with the following changes. For X Layer testnet or mainnet:
module.exports = {
    solidity: "0.8.9",
    networks: {
        xlayer: {
            url: "https://testrpc.xlayer.tech", //or https://rpc.xlayer.tech for mainnet
            accounts: [process.env.PRIVKEY]
        }
    },

X Layer bridge overview#
X Layer employs a flexible message bridge, allowing tokens to move and facilitating communication between layer 1 and layer 2 in a seamless manner. This empowers layer 1 DApps to initiate contract actions on layer 2, and vice versa.

The X Layer zkEVM Bridge smart contract’s main feature is the use of Exit Trees and the Global Exit Tree, with the Global Exit Tree Root as the primary source of state truth.

The use of two distinct Global Exit Root managers for layer 1 and layer 2, as well as separate logic for Bridge smart contract and each of these Global Exit Root managers, allows for extensive network interoperability. Meanwhile, all asset transfers can be validated by any layer 1 and layer 2 nodes due to data availability.

The sections that follow explain how the X Layer ZKEVM Bridge-related smart contracts ensure the security of assets transferred between the ZKEVM and any network.

In the following section, we'll delve into the smart contract used for asset transfer, and the mechanics of sending message/assets across layer 1 and layer 2.

There are currently two ways for users and developers to receive OKB testnet tokens on X Layer.

Use the X Layer official testnet faucet (max of 0.2 OKB) here.
Mint on Sepolia testnet and bridge the tokens to X Layer using the testnet bridge (no limit to amount of OKB).
In this guide, we will show the steps on how to receive OKB testnet.

X Layer official testnet faucet#
The X Layer testnet faucet is an official tool provided by the X Layer team for developers to claim test tokens. Developers and users can use X Layer testnet faucet to obtain:

Testnet OKB tokens
Other ERC-20 tokens
Note
Please note that on the X Layer testnet, each user can only claim 0.2 OKB per day.

Head to the X Layer testnet faucet and click on the Get button for the "Get OKB from X Layer testnet" option.

Asset transfer#
This section describes how asset transfers are enabled by three smart contracts.

Bridge smart contract (ZkEVMBridge.sol
)
Global Exit Root Manager (ZkEVMGlobalExitRoot.sol
)
Consensus contract (ZkEVM.sol
)
Bridge smart contract#
The ZKEVM bridge smart contract (ZkEVMBridge.sol) has two main functions:

Bridge (or deposit) function
Claim (or withdrawal) function
With these functions, we can bridge assets from one network to another, as well as claim assets received in the destination network.

User Deposit transfers assets layer 2 -> layer 1 or layer 1 -> layer 2. The bridge smart contract SC adds an exit leaf to the layer 2 exit tree, which holds the relevant transfer data.
Subsequently, the root of the layer 2 exit tree is updated and becomes accessible for the next smart contract in the workflow, known as the Global Exit Root Manager SC.
User Claim assets on opposite chain bridge SC.
Note
There are two bridge smart contracts: ‌one deployed in layer 1, while the other is deployed in layer 2, both using the same ZKEVMBridge.sol code file, but using different parameters for the interaction.
Global exit root manager contract#
The Global Exit Root Manager SC, implemented as ZkEVMGlobalExitRoot.sol, serves as the overseer of the Global Exit Tree Root. Its primary responsibilities include updating the Global Exit Tree Root and serving as a storage hub for the historical data of the Global Exit Tree.

This contract has a main function:

updateExitRoot This separation of logic between the ZKEVM bridge SC and the Global Exit Root Manager SC has been strategically implemented to enhance interoperability, which uses the function updateExitRoot.
This means that the ZKEVM bridge SC, in conjunction with the Global Exit Root Manager SC, can be installed on any network to achieve the same results.

Note
There are two Global Exit Root manager SCs: one deployed in L1, while the other is deployed in layer 2. Their Solidity code files are; ZkEVMGlobalExitRoot.sol, and ZkEVMGlobalExitRootL2.sol, respectively.
Consensus contract#
The ZkEVM.sol smart contract is the consensus algorithm used in X Layer. It is located in L1 for batch verification purposes. The consensus smart contract (ZkEVM.sol) has two main functions:

sequenceBatchesValidium
verifyBatchesTrustedAggregator
With these functions, layer 2 tx data can be rolled up and verified.

Transactions are grouped into batches by sequenceBatchesValidium function.
A request is made to an aggregator to prove the validity of these sequenced batches by verifyBatchesTrustedAggregator. This proof is ZK-proof and is verified using the Verifier.sol contract.
Following the verification of the ZK-proof, the consensus contract sends the ZKEVM Exit Tree Root to the Global Exit Root Manager SC ZkEVMGlobalExitRoot.sol to update the Global Exit Root.
Smart contract interactions#
The following diagram illustrates the interactions among the three bridge-related smart contracts when assets are bridged. It describes the overall process of transferring assets from layer 1 to layer 2 and from layer 2 to layer 1 through contracts.

Smart contract interactions

layer 1 → layer 2 transfer#
When the user commits to transferring assets, the bridge SC ZkEVMBridge.sol uses the Bridge method to append the corresponding exit leaf to the L1 Exit Tree.
The updated root of the L1 Exit Tree is sent to the Global Exit Root Manager ZkEVMGlobalExitRoot.sol for an update of the Global Exit Root.
The consensus contract ZkEVM.sol retrieves the updated Global Exit Root from the Global Exit Root Manager, which is used for syncing with the ZKEVM as the destination network for bridged assets.
The transfer from layer 1 to ZKEVM is completed with the Claim method of the bridge SC, but this time in the ZKEVM side.

layer 2 → layer 1 transfer#
Now the reverse process, while focusing only at the L1 smart contracts.

The consensus contract uses the sequenceBatchesValidium function to sequence batches, which includes, among other transactions, asset transfer information.
A special smart contract called Verify.sol calls the VerifyBatches function and takes batch info as input. As part of the consensus process, but not shown in the above figure, the aggregator produces a validity proof for the sequenced batches. And this proof is automatically verified in this step.
The ZKEVM Exit Tree gets updated only after a successful verification of sequenced batches (again, for the sake of simplicity, this is not reflected in the above figure). The consensus contract (ZkEVM.sol) sends the updated ZKEVM Exit Root to the Global Exit Root Manager, which subsequently updates the Global Exit Root.
The ZKEVM bridge SC (ZkEVMBridge.sol) then retrieves the updated Global Exit Root and uses the Claim function to complete the transfer.
Specific interaction in layer 2#
The focus in this subsection is on the bridge-related smart contracts used in layer 2, especially in the ZKEVM.

The bridge SC (ZkEVMBridge.sol) in layer 2 is the same smart contract deployed on layer 1.
The L2 Global Exit Root Manager SC is different, and it appears in code as ZkEVMGlobalExitRootL2.sol. This is a special contract that allows synchronization of L2 Exit Tree Root and the Global Exit Root.
The L2 Global Exit Root Manager has storage slots to store the Global Exit Root and the L2 Exit Tree Root. In order to correctly ensure validity of the synchronization between the Global Exit Tree and L2 Exit Tree, these storage slots are directly accessible to the low-level ZK-proof-generating circuit.
Here is the step-by-step process:

layer 2 interactions with ZK-circuit

When a batch of transactions is processed, the ZKEVM bridge SC ZkEVMBridge.sol appends an exit leaf with the batch information to the L2 Exit Tree and updates the L2 Exit Tree Root.
The bridge SC communicates the L2 Exit Tree Root to the L2 Global Exit Root Manager. The L2 Global Exit Root Manager, however, does not update the Global Exit Tree at this stage.
For proof and verification, the circuit for generating ZK-proofs obtains the L2 Exit Tree root from the L2 Global Exit Root Manager.
Only after the batch has been successfully proved and verified does the L2 Global Exit Root Manager append the L2 Exit Tree Root to the Global Exit Tree. As a result, the Global Exit Root is updated.
The circuit for generating ZK-proofs also writes the L2 Exit Tree Root to the mainnet. The ZKEVM bridge SC deployed on L1 can then finalize the transfer by using the Claim function.

Asset transfer (contracts and flows)

Contracts involved:

ZkEVMBridge.sol (Bridge SC)
Functions: Bridge/deposit, Claim/withdrawal
Two deployments: one on L1 and one on L2 (same code, different params)
ZkEVMGlobalExitRoot.sol (Global Exit Root Manager on L1) and ZkEVMGlobalExitRootL2.sol (on L2)
Core function: updateExitRoot
Stores Global Exit Tree history; separates concerns from Bridge SC for interoperability
ZkEVM.sol (Consensus on L1)
Functions: sequenceBatchesValidium, verifyBatchesTrustedAggregator
Uses Verifier.sol to check ZK proofs; after verification, sends Exit Tree Root to Global Exit Root Manager
L1 → L2 transfer flow:

User initiates Bridge on L1 ZkEVMBridge.sol; appends exit leaf to L1 Exit Tree.
L1 Global Exit Root Manager updates the Global Exit Root.
ZkEVM.sol (consensus) reads the updated Global Exit Root for syncing to L2.
On L2, user completes Claim on ZkEVMBridge.sol to receive assets.
L2 → L1 transfer flow:

ZkEVM.sol sequences batches via sequenceBatchesValidium (includes transfer data).
Aggregator generates validity proof; Verifier.sol checks via verifyBatchesTrustedAggregator.
Upon successful proof, ZkEVM Exit Root is sent to Global Exit Root Manager to update the Global Exit Root.
L1 ZkEVMBridge.sol reads the updated Global Exit Root and finalizes with Claim.
L2 specifics with ZK circuit:

L2 ZkEVMBridge appends exit leaf and updates L2 Exit Tree Root.
Communicates L2 Exit Tree Root to ZkEVMGlobalExitRootL2, which does not update the Global Exit Tree yet.
ZK-prover circuit reads the L2 Exit Tree Root directly from L2 GER storage slots for proof generation.
After proof verification, L2 GER appends the L2 Exit Tree Root to the Global Exit Tree, updating the Global Exit Root.
The circuit also writes the L2 Exit Tree Root to mainnet; L1 ZkEVMBridge can then finalize via Claim.
Notes:

Exit Trees exist per domain; the Global Exit Tree Root is the canonical reference used for cross-domain claims.

Flow of assets#
The X Layer bridge is a decentralized bridge that enables users to securely transfer assets between layer 1 and layer 2. Here's how it works:

To bridge an asset from layer 1 to layer 2, the user must lock the asset in layer 1. The layer 2 bridge smart contract will then mint a wrapped token in layer 2, representing an equivalent value of the asset. After the minting process is finished, the user or recipient can claim the asset in layer 2.
In the opposite operation, after burning the wrapped token in layer 2, the layer 1 bridge smart contract unlocks the original asset in L1.
Bridge Asset L1 across layer 2

Asset transferring is enabled by three smart contracts:

The bridge smart contract (ZkEVMBridge.sol)
The global exit root manager (ZkEVMGlobalExitRoot.sol)
The consensus contract (ZkEVM.sol)
Please refer to the previous document for more detailed information:

X Layer bridge smart contracts
Smart contracts for asset transfer
Flow of assets in X Layer bridge#
Asset flow from layer 1 → layer 2#
The Bridge function of the ZKEVM bridge smart contract (ZkEVMBridge.sol) on the L1 network is invoked. If the bridge request is valid, the bridge smart contract appends an exit leaf to the L1 exit tree and computes the new L1 exit tree root.
The Global Exit Root Manager (ZkEVMGlobalExitRoot.sol) appends the new L1 exit tree root to the global exit tree and computes the global exit root.
The Sequencer fetches the latest global exit root from the global exit root manager.
At the start of the transaction batch, the sequencer stores the global exit root in special storage slots of the layer 2 Global Exit Root Manager smart contract (ZkEVMGlobalExitRootL2.sol), allowing L2 users to access it.
In order to complete the bridging process, the user calls the Claim function of the bridge smart contract and provides a Merkle proof to demonstrate that the correct exit leaf was included and represented in the Global Exit Root.
The bridge smart contract obtains the layer 2 Global Exit Root Manager smart contract’s global exit root and validates the user’s Merkle proof of inclusion. If the Merkle proof is valid, the bridging process succeeds; otherwise, the transaction fails.
Asset flow from layer 2 → layer 1#
Sending Message Across L1 and L2

The user calls the Bridge function of the ZKEVM bridge smart contract (ZkEVMBridge.sol) on Layer 2. If the bridge request is valid, the bridge smart contract appends an exit leaf to the L2 Exit Tree and computes the new L2 exit tree root.
The L2 Global Exit Root Manager (ZkEVMGlobalExitRootL2.sol) is called to append the new layer 2 exit tree root to the global exit tree and compute the global exit root:
Note
For the sake of simplicity, the intermediate step is not depicted in the figure below. That step is: The user’s bridging transaction gets included in one of the batches selected and sequenced by the sequencer.
The aggregator generates a ZK-proof attesting to the computational integrity in the execution of sequenced batches (where one of these batches includes the user’s bridging transaction).
For verification purposes, the aggregator sends the ZK-proof together with all relevant batch information that leads to the new L2 Exit Tree root (computed in step 2 above), to the consensus contract (ZkEVM.sol).
The consensus contract utilizes the verifyBatches function to verify validity of the received ZK-proof. If valid, the consensus contract sends the new L2 Exit Tree Root to the Global Exit Root Manager smart contract (ZkEVMGlobalExitRoot.sol) in order to update the Global Exit Tree.
In order to complete the bridging process on the L1 network, the user calls the Claim function of the bridge smart contract, and provides Merkle proof of the fact that the correct exit leaf was included in the computation of Global Exit Root.
The bridge smart contract retrieves the global exit root from the L1 Global Exit Root Manager smart contract and verifies validity of the Merkle proof. If the Merkle proof is valid, the bridge smart contract successfully completes the bridging process. Otherwise, the transaction is reverted.
Note
The architecture shown in the diagram below is simplified, emphasizing the connection between different bridge elements. It doesn't include the interaction between the consensus contract and the sequencer, which is discussed in more detail in earlier subsections of this documentation, particularly in the consensus contract
 section.

Flow of assets (bridge mechanics)

Model:
L1 → L2: Lock on L1, mint wrapped token on L2; user/recipient Claims on L2.
L2 → L1: Burn wrapped token on L2, unlock original asset on L1 upon Claim.
Contracts involved: ZkEVMBridge.sol (Bridge), ZkEVMGlobalExitRoot.sol / ZkEVMGlobalExitRootL2.sol (Global Exit Root managers), ZkEVM.sol (L1 consensus).
L1 → L2 flow

L1 Bridge (Bridge function) appends exit leaf to L1 Exit Tree and computes new L1 Exit Tree root.
L1 Global Exit Root Manager appends this root to the Global Exit Tree and computes the Global Exit Root (GER).
Sequencer fetches the latest GER from the manager.
At batch start, sequencer stores the GER in special storage slots of ZkEVMGlobalExitRootL2 so L2 users can read it.
User calls Claim on L2 Bridge with a Merkle proof of inclusion in the GER.
L2 Bridge reads GER from ZkEVMGlobalExitRootL2 and verifies the proof; if valid, claim succeeds, else reverts.
L2 → L1 flow

L2 Bridge (Bridge function) appends exit leaf to L2 Exit Tree; computes new L2 Exit Tree root.
L2 GER is called to append the new L2 root to the Global Exit Tree and compute GER. Note: the user’s tx is included in a sequenced batch by the sequencer.
Aggregator generates a ZK-proof for sequenced batches (including the bridge tx) and submits it plus batch data to ZkEVM.sol.
ZkEVM.sol verifies via verifyBatches; if valid, it sends the new L2 Exit Tree Root to L1 GER to update the Global Exit Tree.
User calls Claim on L1 Bridge with a Merkle proof of inclusion in the GER.
L1 Bridge retrieves GER from L1 GER and verifies; if valid, the bridge finalizes (assets unlocked); otherwise, reverts.
Notes

GER is the canonical cross-domain reference used for Claims.
Diagrams are simplified and omit some sequencer/consensus interactions covered earlier.

The contract address is different from the current "bridge wrapped" USDC in use today, and has the ability to issue and burn tokens as well as "blacklist" addresses. See USDC-e project
.

L1Escrow
 (L1)
This contract receives layer 1 USDC from users, and triggers the ZKMinterBurner contract on ZKEVM (through the Polygon ZKEVM Bridge) to mint USDC-e. It holds all of the layer 1 backing of USDC-e. It’s also triggered by the Bridge to withdraw layer 1 USDC.

ZKMinterBurner
 (ZKEVM)
This contract receives BridgeWrappedUSDC on ZKEVM and mints back USDC-e. It also has a permissionless publicly callable function called "migrate" which withdraws all BridgedWrappedUSDC to layer 1 through the Bridge. The beneficiary address is the L1Escrow, thus migrating the supply and settling the balance.

Extracting ClaimMessage Arguments#
Event details from bridgeToken

After submission of bridgeToken transactions, a BridgeEvent is emitted by the bridge, which contains fields that are required for construction of claims to the bridge.
originNetwork, originAddress, destinationNetwork, destinationAddress, amount and metadata can be used as is for claimMessage. Deposit count will be used in the subsequent step to extract the other details
Samples of BridgeEvent:
Emitted from a testnet layer 1 to layer 2 bridgeToken transaction
.
bridgeToken testnet tranaction

Mainnet
Emitted from a Mainnet L1 to L2 bridgeToken transaction
.
Notices: originNetwork= 0 (Ethereum), destinationNetwork= 3 (X Layer mainnet)
bridgeToken mainnet tranaction

Extraction from backend#
GET request endpoint: https://<env-specific-domain>/priapi/v1/ob/bridge/merkle-proof?net_id=<networkId>&deposit_cnt=<depositCount>

Replace <env-specific-domain> with the suitable domains, to access XLayer Bridge Service listed below:
Testnet: testrpc.x1.tech
Mainnet: rpc.xlayer.tech
Replace the <networkId> and <depositCount> with a suitable networkId and depositCount (from bridgeEvent).

Construction of globalIndex#
Layout of globalIndex
     * @param globalIndex Global index is defined as:
     * | 191 bits |    1 bit     |   32 bits   |     32 bits    |
     * |    0     |  mainnetFlag | rollupIndex | localRootIndex |
     //concatenating all of the bits above form the globalIndex
     
Description
mainnetFlag
Boolean to represent whether the message originated from layer 1
rollUpIndex
Index of the rollup, according to the RollupManager if mainnet flag is 0
Bridge contract on testnet and mainnet are on different forks, and as such will require different handling
Mainnet - Running UB version of the contract, rollupIndex is networkId - 1.
E.g. For XLayer mainnet, networkId is 3, rollUpIndex to provide is 2
Testnet - Running an older fork of the contract, networkID is 1, but the contract does not verify the exact rollUpIndex
E.g. For XLayer testnet, networkId is 1, but the rollUpIndex accepts 0
localRootIndex
depositCount extracted from step 1.

Bridging USDC workflow (summary)

Key contracts
L1Escrow (L1): Holds L1 USDC backing for USDC-e; receives USDC from users and triggers mint on L2; also releases USDC on L1 during claims.
ZKMinterBurner (L2): Mints/burns USDC-e; has migrate() to bridge all BWUSDC back to L1Escrow.
USDC (L1): Canonical USDC.
USDC-e (L2 “native”): Mint/burn/blacklist capable; “USDC-e”.
BridgedWrappedUSDC (BWUSDC, L2): Wrapped USDC minted by Polygon ZkEVMBridge default wrapper.
NativeConverter (L2): Converts BWUSDC -> USDC-e.
ZkEVMBridge (L1 & L2): Bridge contracts used for messages/assets.
Bridge flows

L1 USDC → L2 USDC-e
approve USDC for L1Escrow on L1
L1Escrow.bridgeToken(destination, amount, true) on L1
claimMessage on L2 Bridge (claims L1Escrow message; ZKMinterBurner mints USDC-e)
L2 USDC-e → L1 USDC
approve USDC-e for ZKMinterBurner on L2
ZKMinterBurner.bridgeToken(destination, amount, true) on L2
claimMessage on L1 Bridge (releases USDC from L1Escrow)
L1 USDC → L2 BWUSDC
approve USDC for ZkEVMBridge on L1
bridgeAsset on L1
claimAsset on L2 (receive BWUSDC)
L2 BWUSDC → L2 USDC-e
approve BWUSDC for NativeConverter
NativeConverter.convert(receiver, amount, permitData)
L2 BWUSDC → L1 USDC (migrate)
NativeConverter.migrate() on L2
claimAsset on L1 (USDC to L1Escrow/recipient)
Transaction APIs (where to send)

L1
bridgeToken(destination, amount, forceUpdateGlobalExitRoot) → To: L1Escrow
claimMessage(proofs..., globalIndex, roots..., origin/destination, amount, metadata) → To: L1 Bridge
approve(spender, amount) → To: L1 USDC
L2
bridgeToken(destination, amount, forceUpdateGlobalExitRoot) → To: ZKMinterBurner
claimMessage(...) → To: L2 Bridge
approve(spender, amount) → To: USDC-e or BWUSDC
convert(receiver, amount, permitData) → To: NativeConverter
migrate() → To: NativeConverter
How to construct claimMessage args

After bridgeToken, read BridgeEvent from the bridge tx logs; use:
originNetwork, originAddress, destinationNetwork, destinationAddress, amount, metadata directly.
depositCount for globalIndex/localRootIndex and to fetch proofs.
Fetch Merkle proofs (backend)
Endpoint: https://<env-domain>/priapi/v1/ob/bridge/merkle-proof?net_id=<networkId>&deposit_cnt=<depositCount>
Testnet domain: testrpc.x1.tech
Mainnet domain: rpc.xlayer.tech
Example net_id values: 0 = L1, 1 = X Layer testnet L2, 3 = X Layer mainnet L2.
Map response to claimMessage:
smtProofLocalExitRoot = proof.merkle_proof
smtProofRollupExitRoot = proof.rollup_merkle_proof
mainnetExitRoot = proof.main_exit_root
rollupExitRoot = proof.rollup_exit_root
globalIndex layout

191 bits zero | 1 bit mainnetFlag | 32 bits rollupIndex | 32 bits localRootIndex
mainnetFlag: 1 if originated from L1, else 0.
rollupIndex:
Mainnet (UB): rollupIndex = networkId - 1 (e.g., X Layer mainnet networkId 3 → rollupIndex 2).
Testnet (older fork): networkId is 1; contract doesn’t strictly verify rollupIndex; 0 is accepted.
localRootIndex: depositCount.
Examples provided:
Testnet L1→L2 with depositCount 1103532 → 18446744073710655148 (0x...00100000000010d6ac)
Testnet L2→L1 with depositCount 772142 → 772142 (0x...00000000000bc82e)
Mainnet L1→L2 with depositCount 177400 → 18446744073709729016 (0x...00100000000002b4f8)

Notes and gotchas

Distinguish USDC-e (native mint/burn on L2) vs BWUSDC (bridge-wrapped).
Always reserve gas on the origin chain.
For testnet, rollupIndex is loosely checked; for mainnet use networkId - 1.
Claim requires correct Merkle proofs and globalIndex derived from depositCount.

The difference between USDC and USDC.e#
USDC#
Circle introduced the Bridged USDC Standard
 to ensure that chain operators can easily deploy a form of bridged USDC that is capable of being upgraded in-place by Circle to native USDC, if and when appropriate, and prevent any fragmentation problems. X Layer official bridge and OKX Exchange has supported this USDC following Circle Bridged standard. It is USDC-e in the flowchart.

Using USDC on X Layer#
Note
Whether you are a developer or a user, we recommend that you use USDC on X Layer.
For users#
Users can get USDC on the X Layer mainnet in these ways:

Using X Layer official bridge
When you bridge USDC from Ethereum to the X Layer by official bridge user interface, you can automatically receive USDC on the X Layer.

Using OKX exchange
OKX now supports USDC (not USDC.e) deposits and withdrawals.

Using third-party bridges
Some well known bridges are integrating with X Layers.

For developers#
Please refer to the USDC workflow section.

Setup local ZKNode#
It’s crucial that developers can thoroughly test the network for a developing blockchain technology like X Layer ZKEVM without putting users or themselves at unnecessary risk. Developers should be able to test their smart contracts, experiment with new code, and play around with the network on their local machines. X Layer ZKEVM has a local development environment setup for this reason. This tutorial will help you create a local single-node ZKEVM blockchain with no connections to external peers. It only exists on your local machine.

CAUTION
Currently the ZKProver does not run on ARM-powered Macs. For Windows users, using WSL/WSL2 is not recommended. Unfortunately, Apple M1 chips are not supported for now - since some optimizations on the ZKProver require specific Intel instructions. This means some non-M1 computers won’t work regardless of the OS, for example: AMD.
After completing this tutorial, you will have the following components running:

ZKEVM node databases
Explorer databases
Layer 1 network
Prover
ZKEVM node components
Explorers
Prerequisites#
The tutorial for current version of the environment requires Foundryup, go, docker and docker-compose to be previously installed on your machine. If you don’t have these installed, check out the links provided below:

https://book.getfoundry.sh/getting-started/installation
https://go.dev/doc/install
https://www.docker.com/get-started
https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/
System requirements#
ZKEVM node: 16GB RAM with 4-core CPU
Mock ZKProver (Default): 16GB RAM with 4-core CPU
Full ZKProver: 1TB RAM with 128-core CPU
If you want to run a full-fledged ZKProver on your own, you’ll need at least 1TB of RAM. If you are unable to meet the Prover requirements, you can still run the zkNode.

Setup ZKNode#
Before starting the ZKEVM node setup, we need to clone the official ZKNode repository
 from xlayer-node Github.

# latest_version refers to https://github.com/okx/xlayer-node/releases
git clone -b latest_version https://github.com/okx/xlayer-node
cd xlayer-node
The xlayer-node docker image must be built at least once and whenever the code is changed. If you haven’t already built the xlayer-node image, you must run:

make build-docker
Certain commands on the xlayer-node can interact with smart contracts, run specific components, create encryption files, and print debug information. To interact with the binary program, we provide docker-compose files and a Makefile to spin up/down the various services and components, ensuring smooth local deployment and a better command line interface for developers.

Note
All the data is stored inside of each docker container. This means once you remove the container, the data will be lost.
The test/ directory contains scripts and files for developing and debugging. Change the working directory to test/ on your local machine.

cd test/
Now, run the ZKNode environment:

make run
To stop the ZKNode:

make stop
To restart the whole ZKNode environment:

make restart
Configuration parameters#
The Synchronizer regularly pulls for network updates, mainly from Ethereum but also via the Trusted Sequencer’s broadcasting mechanism, in order to stay up-to-date. Unless otherwise specified in the setup, the Synchronizer’s default syncing rate is every 2 seconds. The Keystore file, used to store private keys, is normally required for running the Sequencer & Aggregator but not for a Synchronizer/RPC-setup.

Note
We have the inconvenient situation where the Keystore file is required to run the node when it shouldn’t be, for example, if no transactions are sent to layer 1. Keystore is not required in the Mango Testnet as it uses a trusted sequencer and aggregator. This will be reviewed when a decentralised ZKEVM network is implemented.
Sample data#
It’s important to populate your local ZKEVM node with some data before you start testing out the network. The make run command will execute the containers required to run the environment, but it will not execute anything else. Your local layer 2 network will be essentially empty. The following scripts are available if you require sample data that has already been deployed to the network.

cast send --legacy --from 0x2ECF31eCe36ccaC2d3222A303b1409233ECBB225 --private-key 0xde3ca643a52f5543e84ba984c4419ff40dbabd0e483c31c1d09fee8168d68e38 --rpc-url http://127.0.0.1:8123 0xC949254d682D8c9ad5682521675b8F43b102aec4 --value 10ether

# To add some examples of transactions and smart contracts:
make deploy-sc

# To deploy a full Uniswap environment:
make deploy-uniswap

# To grant the OKB smart contract a set amount of tokens:
make run-approve-matic
Connecting to Metamask#
Note
Metamask requires the network to be running while configuring it, so make sure your network is up.
To configure your MetaMask to use your local ZKEVM environment, follow these steps:

Log in to your MetaMask wallet.
Click on your account picture and then on Settings.
On the left menu, click on Networks.
Click on Add Network button.
Fill in the layer 2 network information:
Network Name: X Layer zkEVM - Local
New RPC URL: http://localhost:8123
ChainID: 1001
Currency Symbol: OKB
Block Explorer URL: http://localhost:4000
Click on Save.
Click on Add Network button.
Fill in the layer 1 network information:
Network name: Geth - Local
New RPC URL: http://localhost:8545
ChainID: 1337
Currency symbol: ETH
Click on Save.
You can now interact with your local ZKEVM network and sign transactions from your MetaMask wallet.

Setup local ZKNode (summary and quick steps)

Goal: Run a single-node, fully local X Layer zkEVM stack (no external peers) for safe dev/testing.
Cautions

ZKProver doesn’t run on ARM Macs (e.g., Apple M1/M2) or many AMD CPUs due to Intel-specific optimizations. WSL/WSL2 on Windows is not recommended.
Full ZKProver hardware is extreme (1 TB RAM, 128 cores). Use the default Mock Prover for local dev.
Prerequisites

Foundry (foundryup) for cast
Go
Docker and Docker Compose
Recommended machine: ≥16 GB RAM, 4 cores
Clone and build

latest_version is the tag from https://github.com/okx/xlayer-node/releases
git clone -b latest_version https://github.com/okx/xlayer-node
cd xlayer-node
make build-docker
Run the local environment

cd test/
make run // start all containers
make stop // stop
make restart // restart
Notes on data and config

All data lives inside the Docker containers; removing containers wipes data.
Synchronizer polls every ~2s (L1 and via Trusted Sequencer broadcast).
Keystore: currently required by the node even when it shouldn’t be; not required on Mango Testnet due to trusted sequencer/aggregator.
Populate sample data (optional)

Send L2 OKB to a local address: cast send --legacy --from 0x2ECF31eCe36ccaC2d3222A303b1409233ECBB225 --private-key 0xde3ca643a52f5543e84ba984c4419ff40dbabd0e483c31c1d09fee8168d68e38 --rpc-url http://127.0.0.1:8123 0xC949254d682D8c9ad5682521675b8F43b102aec4 --value 10ether
Deploy sample contracts: make deploy-sc
Deploy Uniswap example: make deploy-uniswap
Approve OKB for examples: make run-approve-matic
Connect MetaMask

Ensure the local network is running before adding networks.
L2 (zkEVM local)
Network Name: X Layer zkEVM - Local
RPC: http://localhost:8123
Chain ID: 1001
Symbol: OKB
Block Explorer: http://localhost:4000
L1 (Geth local)
Network Name: Geth - Local

Common pitfalls and tips

Ensure ports 8123 (L2 RPC), 8545 (L1 RPC), 4000 (explorer) are free.
Docker Desktop resources: allocate enough CPU/RAM (≥4 cores, 8–16 GB) or containers may crash.
cast is provided by Foundry; run foundryup if cast is missing.
If you remove containers, your chain state resets; back up volumes if you need persistence.
Send the next section when ready; I’ll keep noting until you say “done.”

Setup production ZKNode#
X Layer is now available on the Mainnet and Testnet for developers to launch smart contracts, execute transactions, and experiment with the network. This tutorial extends the exploration by allowing developers to launch their own node on the Public network. Before we begin, this document is fairly technical and requires prior exposure to Docker and CLI. Post spinning up your ZKNode instance, you will be able to run the Synchronizer and utilize the JSON-RPC interface.

Prerequisites#
This tutorial assumes that you have docker-compose already installed. If you need any help with the installation, please check the official docker-compose installation guide
.

Minimum System requirements#
CAUTION
ZKProver does not work on ARM-based Macs yet, and using WSL/WSL2 on Windows is not advisable. Currently, ZKProver optimizations require CPUs that support the AVX2 instruction, which means some non-M1 computers, such as AMD, won’t work with the software regardless of the OS.
16GB RAM
4-core CPU
1 TB Storage (This will increase over time)
Network components#
Here is a list of crucial network components that are required before you can run the ZKNode:

Ethereum Node - Use geth or any service providing a JSON RPC interface for accessing the layer 1 network
X Layer-Node (or ZKNode) - layer 2 network
Synchronizer - Responsible for synchronizing data between layer 1 and layer 2
JSON RPC Server - Interface to layer 2 network
State DB - Save the layer 2 account, block and tx data.
Let’s set up each of the above components!

Ethereum node setup#
The Ethereum RPC Node is the first component to be deployed because ZKNode needs to synchronize blocks and transactions on layer 1. You can invoke the ETH RPC (Mainnet: Ethereum OR Testnet: Sepolia) service through any of the following methods:

Third-party RPC services, such as Infura
 or Ankr
.
Set up your own Ethereum node. Follow the instructions provided in this guide to set up and install Geth
.
Set up an Erigon RPC Node here:
Mainnet
Testnet
Installing#
Once the layer 1 RPC component is complete, we can start the ZKNode setup. This is the most straightforward way to run a ZKNode and it’s fine for most use cases. Furthermore, this method is purely subjective and feel free to run this software in a different manner. For example, Docker is not required, you could simply use the Go binaries directly. Let’s start setting up our ZKNode:

Download the installation script
mkdir -p ./xlayer-node && cd ./xlayer-node

# mainnet
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/okx/Deploy/main/setup/zknode/run_xlayer_mainnet.sh | bash -s init && cp ./mainnet/example.env ./mainnet/.env
# testnet
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/okx/Deploy/main/setup/zknode/run_xlayer_testnet.sh | bash -s init && cp ./testnet/example.env ./testnet/.env
The example.env file must be modified according to your configurations. Edit the .env file with your favourite editor (we’ll use vim in this guide):
# mainnet
vim ./mainnet/.env

# testnet
vim ./testnet/.env
# URL of a JSON RPC for Ethereum mainnet or Sepolia testnet
XLAYER_NODE_ETHERMAN_URL = "http://your.L1node.url"

# PATH WHERE THE STATEDB POSTGRES CONTAINER WILL STORE PERSISTENT DATA
XLAYER_NODE_STATEDB_DATA_DIR = "./xlayer_mainnet_data/statedb" # OR ./xlayer_testnet_datastatedb/ for testnet

# PATH WHERE THE POOLDB POSTGRES CONTAINER WILL STORE PERSISTENT DATA #
XLAYER_NODE_POOLDB_DATA_DIR = "./xlayer_mainnet_data/pooldb" # OR ./xlayer_testnet_data/pooldb/ for testnet
Restore the latest layer 2 snapshot locally database for synchronizing layer 2 data quickly.
# mainnet
./run_xlayer_mainnet.sh restore 

# testnet
./run_xlayer_testnet.sh restore 
Starting#
Use the below command to start the ZKNode instance:

# mainnet
./run_xlayer_mainnet.sh start

# testnet
./run_xlayer_testnet.sh start

docker ps -a
You will see a list of the following containers :

xlayer-rpc
xlayer-sync
xlayer-state-db
xlayer-pool-db
xlayer-prover
You should now be able to run queries to the JSON-RPC endpoint at http://localhost:8545
. Run the following query to get the most recently synchronized layer 2 block; if you call it every few seconds, you should see the number grow:

curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST --data '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"eth_blockNumber","params":[],"id":83}' http://localhost:8545
Stopping#
Use the below command to stop the ZKNode instance:

# mainnet
./run_xlayer_mainnet.sh stop

# testnet
./run_xlayer_testnet.sh stop
Restarting#
Use the below command to stop the ZKNode instance:

# mainnet
./run_xlayer_mainnet.sh restart

# testnet
./run_xlayer_testnet.sh restart
Updating#
To update the ZKNode software, run the below command, and the file ./mainnet(or testnet)/.env will be retained, the other config will be deleted.

# mainnet
./run_xlayer_mainnet.sh update

# testnet
./run_xlayer_testnet.sh update
Troubleshooting#
It’s possible that the machine you’re using already uses some of the necessary ports. In this case, you can change them directly ./mainnet(testnet)/docker-compose.yml.
If one or more containers are crashing, please check the logs using the command below:
docker ps -a

docker logs <cointainer_name>
Force resync From specific batch#
Stop xlayer-sync and xlayer-rpc services
docker stop xlayer-sync
docker stop xlayer-rpc
Select max verified batch
PGPASSWORD=state_password psql -h 127.0.0.1 -p 5432 -d state_db -U state_user

SELECT max(batch_num) FROM state.verified_batch;
# Use the batch_num above  to perform the resync from a specific batch (e.g. 330000):
Look for the target block and batch to delete
Look for this batch in OK Link
 and get "Sequence Tx Hash" value (0xf5bcff8bc5e03be47e36d642d26f0551ff4a66094e1fb67c9e02ec739c7fca82)
Go to previous batches (you can use "<" button) until you reach the first batch sequenced with the same "Sequence Tx Hash" (in this example 329992).
Look for the "Sequence Tx Hash" in etherscan
 to get the layer 1 block where that tx was confirmed (in this example 5517146).
Delete the block and batch
delete from state.block where block_num >= 5517146; 
delete from state.batch where batch_num >= 329992;
Start the sync service to sync again.

XLAYER_NODE_STATEDB_DATA_DIR="./xlayer_mainnet_data/statedb" (or ./xlayer_testnet_data/statedb)
XLAYER_NODE_POOLDB_DATA_DIR="./xlayer_mainnet_data/pooldb" (or ./xlayer_testnet_data/pooldb)
Restore latest L2 snapshot (faster initial sync):
Mainnet: ./run_xlayer_mainnet.sh restore
Testnet: ./run_xlayer_testnet.sh restore
Start/stop/restart/update

Start: ./run_xlayer_mainnet.sh start (or ./run_xlayer_testnet.sh start)
Stop: ./run_xlayer_mainnet.sh stop (or testnet)
Restart: ./run_xlayer_mainnet.sh restart (or testnet)
Update binaries/configs (keeps .env): ./run_xlayer_mainnet.sh update (or testnet)
What you should see (docker ps -a)

xlayer-rpc, xlayer-sync, xlayer-state-db, xlayer-pool-db, xlayer-prover
Health check (JSON-RPC)

Endpoint: http://localhost:8545
Latest L2 block: curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST --data '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"eth_blockNumber","params":[],"id":83}' http://localhost:8545
Call every few seconds; height should increase.
Troubleshooting

Ports in use: edit ./mainnet/docker-compose.yml or ./testnet/docker-compose.yml to change bindings.
Container crashes: docker ps -a then docker logs <container_name>.
Force resync from specific batch:
Stop services: docker stop xlayer-sync && docker stop xlayer-rpc
Connect Postgres: PGPASSWORD=state_password psql -h 127.0.0.1 -p 5432 -d state_db -U state_user
Find last verified: SELECT max(batch_num) FROM state.verified_batch;
Identify target batch/block to delete:
In OKLink, find “Sequence Tx Hash” for the target batch; go back to the first batch with same Sequence Tx Hash.
In Etherscan, open that tx to get the L1 block number.
Delete from DB:
delete from state.block where block_num >= <L1_block>;
delete from state.batch where batch_num >= <first_batch_with_that_sequence_tx>;
Start sync again.
Notes

JSON-RPC default is 8545 locally.
Storage paths in .env should point to persistent host directories if you want data to survive container recreation.

Prerequisite readings#
Before you begin using RPC endpoints on X Layer, it’s important to read the relevant articles for guidance:

Ethereum JSON-RPC
Starting HTTP JSON-RPC#
To start the HTTP JSON-RPC, curl method is recommended:

# mainnet
curl -X POST --data '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"eth_blockNumber","params":[],"id":1}' -H "Content-Type: application/json" https://rpc.xlayer.tech
# testnet
curl -X POST --data '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"eth_blockNumber","params":[],"id":1}' -H "Content-Type: application/json" https://testrpc.xlayer.tech
JSON-RPC methods#
There are two types of RPC methods on X Layer, one is Ethereum compatible RPC, and the other one is ZKEVM RPC. Each RPC offers specific functionalities.

1. Ethereum compatible RPC#
Here you will find the list of all supported JSON RPC endpoints and the differences between them in comparison to the default behavior of an Ethereum node. If a specific endpoint is not in the list below, it means that this specific endpoint is not supported yet. You can find more details in Ethereum’s JSON-RPC doc

Websocket endpoints#
X Layer supports Websocket methods that are compatible with Ethereum, and ZKEVM RPC methods for ZKEVM.

The WebSockets (WSS) communication protocol enables two-way communication between a client and a server over a single TCP connection. The communication protocol maintains a network connection between the two parties, allowing for real-time, low-latency communication. WebSockets allow for ongoing, bidirectional communication unlike HTTP, which is a request-response protocol.

Mainnet (chain-id: 0xC4, 196 in decimals)#
WSS:

wss://xlayerws.okx.com
wss://ws.xlayer.tech
Testnet (chain-id: 0xC3, 195 in decimals)#
WSS:

wss://xlayertestws.okx.com
wss://testws.xlayer.tech
Websocket methods#
Subscription methods are available for WebSocket connections only, and allow you to wait for events instead of polling for them. For example, DApps can subscribe to logs and receive notifications when a specific event occurs.

The following subscription methods are available:

eth_subscribe - Create a subscription to a particular event
eth_unsubscribe - Cancel an active subscription
It also supports Ethereum compatible and ZKEVM RPC methods with websocket. You need to install ws
, or another websocket client

# install wss tools
go install github.com/hashrocket/ws@latest

# connect to the wss server
ws wss://xlayertestws.okx.com
eth_subscribe#
Subscribe to different Ethereum event types like newHeads, logs, pendingTransactions, and minedTransactions using WebSockets.

Parameters Specify the subscription event parameters, including the following:

newHeads: Subscribing to this returns a notification each time a new header is appended to the chain, including chain reorganizations. In chain reorganization, the subscription emits all new headers for the new chain. Therefore, the subscription can emit multiple headers at the same height.
logs: Returns logs that are included in new imported blocks and match the given filter criteria. In case of a chain reorganization, previously sent logs that are on the old chain are resent with the removed property set to true. Logs from transactions that ended up in the new chain are emitted. Therefore, a subscription can emit logs for the same transaction multiple times. This parameter has the following fields:
address: (optional) Either an address or an array of addresses. Only logs that are created from these addresses are returned.
topics: (optional) Only logs that match these specified topics are returned.
newPendingTransactions: not supported
Returns subscription ID: The ID of the newly created subscription on the node.

Websocket endpoints (summary)

Purpose: Full-duplex, low‑latency communication; supports Ethereum-compatible and zkEVM RPC over WS.
Endpoints

Mainnet (chainId 196 / 0xC4):
wss://xlayerws.okx.com
wss://ws.xlayer.tech
Testnet (chainId 195 / 0xC3):
wss://xlayertestws.okx.com
wss://testws.xlayer.tech
Subscriptions (WS-only)

eth_subscribe: newHeads, logs (with optional address[], topics[]). newPendingTransactions not supported.
eth_unsubscribe: cancel by subscription ID.
Behavior notes:
Reorgs: newHeads may emit multiple headers at same height; logs from old chain are resent with removed=true.
Usage

Install a WS client (example): go install github.com/hashrocket/ws@latest
Connect: ws wss://xlayertestws.okx.com
Example:
Subscribe new heads: {"id":1,"method":"eth_subscribe","params":["newHeads"]}
Subscribe logs by topic: {"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"eth_subscribe","params":["logs",{"topics":["0x...topic"]}],"id":1}
Unsubscribe: {"id":1,"method":"eth_unsubscribe","params":["0x<subscriptionId>"]}
Other WS calls

You can invoke standard Ethereum JSON-RPC (e.g., eth_gasPrice) and zkEVM RPC over WS as well.

Gas station#
X Layer gas station aims to help DApp developers by suggesting gas prices before they send transactions on the X Layer network. It's now on the X Layer testnet, checking 1500 recent transactions for price recommendations.

Usage#
Send a GET request to the X Layer Gas Station endpoint
 to get a gas price recommendation from this oracle.

cURL#
curl https://testrpc.xlayer.tech/gasstation
JavaScript#
fetch('https://testrpc.xlayer.tech/gasstation')  .then(response => response.json())  .then(json => console.log(json))
Python#
import requestsrequests.get('https://testrpc.xlayer.tech/gasstation').json()
Interpretation#
An example JSON response will look like this:

{
        "safeLow": 1,
        "standard": 1,
        "fast": 1,
        "fastest": 1,
        "blockTime": 2,
        "blockNumber": 308789
}
safelow, standard, fast, fastest are gas prices in Gwei. Feel free to utilize these prices according to your requirements before submitting the transaction to the X Layer testnet.
blockTime, in seconds, gives the average block time of the network.
blockNumber furnishes details about the most recent mined block at the time the recommendation was generated.

Gas station (summary and usage)

Purpose: Recommend gas prices for X Layer testnet by sampling ~1,500 recent txs.
Endpoint (testnet only): https://testrpc.xlayer.tech/gasstation
Response fields (gwei): safeLow, standard, fast, fastest; plus blockTime (seconds) and blockNumber.
Quick calls

cURL: curl https://testrpc.xlayer.tech/gasstation
JS: fetch('https://testrpc.xlayer.tech/gasstation').then(r => r.json()).then(console.log)
Python: import requests; requests.get('https://testrpc.xlayer.tech/gasstation').json()
How to use in transactions

Legacy-style gasPrice (works broadly on L2s):
Set tx.gasPrice = parseUnits(tier, "gwei")
EIP-1559-style:
Set both maxFeePerGas and maxPriorityFeePerGas to a chosen tier (or add a small buffer, e.g., +10%).
Example (ethers v6)

JavaScript
import { parseUnits, JsonRpcProvider, Wallet } from "ethers";

const provider = new JsonRpcProvider("https://xlayertestrpc.okx.com");
const wallet = new Wallet(process.env.PRIV_KEY, provider);

async function sendTx() {
  const { fast } = await fetch("https://testrpc.xlayer.tech/gasstation").then(r => r.json());
  const fee = parseUnits(String(fast), "gwei");

  const txRequest = {
    to: "0xRecipientAddress",
    value: parseUnits("0.01", "ether"),
    // Choose one approach:
    // legacy:
    // gasPrice: fee,
    // or EIP-1559:
    maxFeePerGas: fee,
    maxPriorityFeePerGas: fee,
  };

  // Always estimate gas
  txRequest.gasLimit = await provider.estimateGas(txRequest);

  const tx = await wallet.sendTransaction(txRequest);
  console.log("sent:", tx.hash);
  console.log("receipt:", await tx.wait());
}

sendTx().catch(console.error);
Example (web3.py)

Python
from web3 import Web3
import requests

w3 = Web3(Web3.HTTPProvider("https://testrpc.xlayer.tech"))
gas = requests.get("https://testrpc.xlayer.tech/gasstation").json()
fee_wei = w3.to_wei(gas["standard"], "gwei")

tx = {
    "to": "0xRecipientAddress",
    "value": w3.to_wei("0.01", "ether"),
    "nonce": w3.eth.get_transaction_count("0xYourAddress"),
    "gasPrice": fee_wei,  # or set maxFeePerGas/maxPriorityFeePerGas for EIP-1559 style
}
tx["gas"] = w3.eth.estimate_gas(tx)

signed = w3.eth.account.sign_transaction(tx, private_key="0xYOUR_PRIV_KEY")
tx_hash = w3.eth.send_raw_transaction(signed.rawTransaction)
print(tx_hash.hex())
Tips

Use eth_estimateGas before sending.
Cache the gasstation response briefly to avoid extra calls; fall back to provider.getGasPrice()/getFeeData() if gasstation is unavailable.
Values are for testnet; production mainnet gas may differ.
Send the next section when ready; I’ll keep noting until you say “done.”

Bridging (user flows on testnet UI)

Sepolia → X Layer testnet
Select Sepolia (left) → X Layer testnet (right), connect wallet, choose token (e.g., ETH), enter amount, Bridge, confirm in UI and wallet; track pending txs.
Reserve ETH for Sepolia gas.
X Layer testnet → Sepolia
Select X Layer testnet (left) → Sepolia (right), connect wallet, choose token (e.g., OKB), Bridge, confirm; then Claim on Sepolia to finalize.
Reserve OKB for X Layer gas.
Bridging architecture (contracts and data flow)

Core contracts
ZkEVMBridge.sol (Bridge): Bridge/deposit and Claim/withdraw functions; deployed on L1 and L2 (same code, different params).
ZkEVMGlobalExitRoot.sol (L1) and ZkEVMGlobalExitRootL2.sol (L2): updateExitRoot; maintain the Global Exit Tree (GER) and history.
ZkEVM.sol (L1 consensus): sequenceBatchesValidium, verifyBatchesTrustedAggregator; verifies ZK proofs (via Verifier.sol) and posts Exit Tree roots to GER.
L1 → L2 flow
L1 Bridge adds exit leaf to L1 Exit Tree; L1 GER updates Global Exit Root.
Sequencer fetches GER, stores it in L2 GER special slots at batch start.
User calls Claim on L2 with Merkle proof of inclusion in GER; L2 Bridge validates against L2 GER and releases wrapped asset.
L2 → L1 flow
L2 Bridge appends exit leaf to L2 Exit Tree; sequencer includes tx in batches.
Aggregator generates ZK proof for sequenced batches; ZkEVM.sol verifies.
On success, ZkEVM.sol sends new L2 Exit Root to L1 GER; user Claims on L1 with Merkle proof; L1 Bridge finalizes.
USDC on X Layer and bridging workflows

Token types and mainnet addresses
USDC (Circle Bridged USDC Standard, upgradable to native): 0x74b7F16337b8972027F6196A17a631aC6dE26d22
USDC.e (bridge‑wrapped, “BWUSDC” in diagrams): 0xA8CE8aee21bC2A48a5EF670afCc9274C7bbbC035
Key contracts
L1 (Ethereum): USDC 0xA0b8…6eB48; L1Escrow 0xfe3240…15150; Bridge 0x2a3DD3…a2EDe
X Layer mainnet (L2): ZKMinterBurner 0x1A8C49…4728; NativeConverter 0x9258cC…3D45; Bridge 0x2a3DD3…a2EDe
Sepolia testnet / X Layer testnet: provided addresses for L1Escrow, USDC, Bridge (Sepolia) and USDC.e/BWUSDC, USDC (USDC‑e), ZKMinterBurner, NativeConverter, Bridge (X Layer testnet).
Recommended: Prefer USDC (not USDC.e) for users and devs where possible.
Flows
L1 USDC → L2 USDC‑e:
approve USDC to L1Escrow; 2) L1Escrow.bridgeToken(dest, amount, true); 3) claimMessage on L2 (mints USDC‑e via ZKMinterBurner).
L2 USDC‑e → L1 USDC:
approve USDC‑e to ZKMinterBurner; 2) ZKMinterBurner.bridgeToken(...); 3) claimMessage on L1 (releases from L1Escrow).
L1 USDC → L2 BWUSDC:
approve USDC to ZkEVMBridge; 2) bridgeAsset on L1; 3) claimAsset on L2.
L2 BWUSDC → L2 USDC‑e:
approve BWUSDC to NativeConverter; 2) convert(receiver, amount, permitData).
Migrate BWUSDC → L1 USDC:
NativeConverter.migrate() on L2; 2) claimAsset on L1 (sends to L1Escrow).
ClaimMessage construction
Read BridgeEvent after bridgeToken; use origin/destination fields and amount/metadata directly; depositCount used for proofs and globalIndex.
Fetch proofs:
Testnet: https://testrpc.x1.tech/priapi/v1/ob/bridge/merkle-proof?net_id=<0|1>&deposit_cnt=<depositCount>
Mainnet: https://rpc.xlayer.tech/priapi/v1/ob/bridge/merkle-proof?net_id=<0|3>&deposit_cnt=<depositCount>
Map: smtProofLocalExitRoot = proof.merkle_proof; smtProofRollupExitRoot = proof.rollup_merkle_proof; mainnetExitRoot = proof.main_exit_root; rollupExitRoot = proof.rollup_exit_root
globalIndex layout: [191 bits 0 | 1 bit mainnetFlag | 32 bits rollupIndex | 32 bits localRootIndex(depositCount)]
Mainnet: rollupIndex = networkId − 1 (e.g., X Layer mainnet networkId 3 → 2)
Testnet: older fork accepts 0 for rollupIndex
Nodes

Local ZKNode (single‑node dev)
Requirements: Docker/Compose, Foundry, Go; ≥16 GB RAM/4 cores. ARM Macs/WSL not supported for Prover; use Mock Prover.
Steps: git clone okx/xlayer-node (latest release tag) → make build-docker → cd test → make run|stop|restart
Sample data: make deploy-sc, make deploy-uniswap, sample cast send; OKB approve helper.
MetaMask local config: L2 RPC http://localhost:8123 (ChainID 1001, Explorer http://localhost:4000, symbol OKB); L1 RPC http://localhost:8545 (ChainID 1337).
Production ZKNode (public mainnet/testnet)
Requirements: docker‑compose; 16 GB RAM, 4 cores, 1 TB storage; AVX2 CPU.
Need an L1 RPC (self‑hosted Geth/Erigon or providers like Infura/Ankr).
Install: curl the run_xlayer_mainnet.sh or run_xlayer_testnet.sh scripts; copy example.env to .env; set:
XLAYER_NODE_ETHERMAN_URL (your L1 RPC)
STATEDB and POOLDB data dirs
Optional: ./run_… restore to load latest L2 snapshot.
Operate: ./run_… start|stop|restart|update; containers: xlayer-rpc, xlayer-sync, xlayer-state-db, xlayer-pool-db, xlayer-prover.
Health check: POST eth_blockNumber to http://localhost:8545
Troubleshooting: adjust ports in docker-compose; docker logs; force resync by stopping services, pruning state DB from target L1 block/batch, then restarting sync.

Gas station (testnet)

Endpoint: https://testrpc.xlayer.tech/gasstation
Returns JSON: safeLow/standard/fast/fastest (gwei), blockTime (s), blockNumber.
Use tiers directly for gasPrice or for EIP‑1559 maxFeePerGas/maxPriorityFeePerGas (optionally add a small buffer).
Wallet maintenance FAQs

MetaMask: Clear activity/nonce data only if necessary (stuck txs); network‑scoped and irreversible but funds safe.
OKX Wallet: Full reset wipes keys and data—back up first; reimport after.
What I still need from you to complete the “everything” summary

Hackathons: event overview, timelines, tracks, prizes, submission rules, judging criteria.
OKS DEX API: base URLs, auth, endpoints, request/response schemas, rate limits.
Trade API and Market API: endpoints, parameters, examples, websockets vs REST, pagination, error codes.
Paste those details (or links), and I’ll fold them into this summary and produce a clean, shareable document.
